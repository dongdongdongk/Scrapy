        (ominous music),- [Man] It was a Saturday night.,- [Woman] It was a discotheque,where a lot of Americans, G.I.s went in.,- [Man] I was the manager.,- [Woman] I was a bartender, barkeeper.,We had a lot of fun over there.,The Americans were pretty,much party people. (laughs),I knew Edward before.,He came three months,before that thing happened.,Sometimes with his friends,,
,
,
,
,Sometimes he came alone,,and he would sit at the bar.,What I can remember he was...,a little bit shy.,But when you knew him a little while,,he was very friendly, very friendly.,When he came in he was very lucky,that he got two places right,by where the beer taps are.,There was a girl with him,,and it seemed to me like,he was very interested.,And she also.,Like she gave him the feeling,maybe there can happen,something between us.,
,
,
,
,Then there was a third person.,He was standing in the back,and always staring at,Edward and that girl.,So I always watched him.,And when they left the Western Saloon,,Between 12:00 and 12:30 I think.,I saw that guy follow them.,The next day, they showed me,the pictures of Edward's body.,Like he was found.,And the open wound in,his face from the shot.,His side was broken,open, everything bloody.,(melancholy music),My brother was like a superhero.,My brother was like immortal.,Whatever he did, I wanted to do.,Whatever he was, I wanted to be.,He met some Germans, befriended them.,He left the bar with a,woman he had just met,,and the next morning he was,found dead in the woods,,shot in the head.,We had a Catholic wake and a service,,and we weren't gonna have an open casket,,'cause he didn't look so great.,But we all wanted to see him.,We all wanted to know,that it was actually him.,He was given a military burial with honors,at Maple Grove Cemetery,in our neighborhood.,And even though it was,in the middle of Queens,,in the middle of a weekday,,my brother got a 21-gun salute.,And I was a little freaked out,to hear guns at my brother's funeral,when I was still like, oh my god,,my brother was shot in the head.,That part was a little difficult.,(guns blasting),At first we didn't know anything,about why my brother had been shot.,And then, about a week later,,a letter arrived at a news,agency, claiming responsibility.,And they had sent in his ID card.,And then we found out,that he had been kidnapped,so that they could steal his ID,to get a bomb onto a U.S. airbase,that exploded and killed two other people.,When I first heard they were,terrorists, I was very confused,about whether or not,they were Middle Eastern,,and when it turned out,they were actually German,,then there was just this disconnect,,'cause it didn't fit the,stereotype in my head,that they would be Middle Eastern people.,So I was confused at,first, and I was like,,German terrorists, what's that?,All that I knew was that,they had planted this bomb,and that two other people had died.,And they were called the Red Army Faction.,To me, the Red Army Faction,was just a bunch of monsters.,They were just horrible,,horrible, subhuman people.,And I had no problem, in the beginning,,saying they should all,just be lined up and shot.,- [Desireena] When we were teenagers,,Kathleen was one of my closest friends.,The murder of her brother,changed Kathleen's life.,And years later, it would change mine.,Kathleen and I were friends in,high school in New York City.,I was one of the few people she told,about Eddie's murder at the time.,In a sea of urban liberal,teenagers, Kathleen stood apart.,- [Kathleen] Pretty much,every conservative idea,,like at some point or another, I've held.,Like the inevitability of war,,the importance of trying,to win a nuclear war.,- [Desireena] I completely,disagreed with her politics,,but something about her,self-assurance drew me in.,Kathleen and I were from different worlds.,I was a recent immigrant,from the Philippines,,living with my mom,,dad, and four siblings.,Kathleen would visit us often,,but I never met her family.,At 14, she seemed fully self-sufficient,,and had that very American,air of self confidence.,I knew she lived with her mom,,her grandparents, and her sister.,Later I found out that her family,were Mexican-American, from Texas.,She planned to follow in,her brother's footsteps,,to enlist in the Army and,pursue a career in the military.,Not long after his death,,she also came out as gay.,On both counts, I was speechless.,We soon drifted apart, and,lost touch after graduation.,But for years, I felt,that I wanted to find her.,When she came back to New York,to care for her terminally,ill mother, we reconnected.,She told me she'd been,working with people in prison,,and kept talking about something,called restorative justice.,- [Kathleen] People change,,we change our perspectives,,we change our actions.,- [Desireena] As fiercely,conservative as Kathleen once was,,she was now just as fiercely progressive.,Then she told me something,that blew my mind.,She said she wanted to,meet with Eddie's killers.,I was utterly shocked.,It was the opposite of everything I knew.,How would it work?,What would reconciliation look like?,I felt so lost after Eddie was dead.,I still felt like I was,seeking his approval.,It felt like he was a constant presence.,- [Desireena] At school,,Kathleen kept seeing,glimpses of Eddie in the hallways.,I would see the back of someone's hair,,it was like short brown hair.,Or I would just see,their eyes with glasses,,and I'd be like, oh my god.,And it was just so, I mean,I just missed him so much,that I was constantly,like, maybe that's him.,There was such a feeling of,like, maybe he's not dead.,And you know, especially,'cause I was a teen.,I mean I had seen his body,,but I was still like no, no,,maybe he's not dead; it,was total magical thinking.,(soft guitar music),We grew up totally on top of each other.,There were six of us in,a two-bedroom apartment.,My grandparents shared a room.,My mom and my sister,and I shared a bedroom,,and my brother slept on the couch.,He would make that bed every evening,,so he could sleep in it, and,he would make it every morning.,He and my sister would get,out of the house together.,My sister was a teenager with him,,and they would get to go out,hang out with their friends.,We were very patriotic, we were,really proud to be American,,like a lot of Latino families.,We felt like we had a responsibility,to protect the country that we loved.,My mom joined the Navy,when she was a young woman.,My aunt became a civilian,with the military.,My grandfather was really proud,when both my mother and my aunt,found men to marry who,were in the military.,- [Desireena] By the time I,met Kathleen in high school,,she never mentioned a father.,During our junior year,,right after Eddie's death,,Kathleen's family found out she was gay.,I hated being gay.,We were a really Catholic family,,a really conservative Catholic family,,and I think we were all struggling,with the idea that I was,going to burn in hell.,- [Desireena] At Stuyvesant,,Kathleen was perpetually clad,in her brother's green Army jacket.,The jacket was not only,a cloak of mourning,,but marked Kathleen as queer,,even before she articulated it.,At some point, she began a relationship,with a girl in our clique,,and although she would come out to us,,she was very mindful of their privacy.,As someone who was thinking,about my own sexuality,,I was quietly in awe.,I think there were lots,of kids at Stuyvesant,who took a more liberal view,of sexuality and sexual orientation,,but I was not among them.,Eddie had made his views on,homosexuality really clear,,of how much he disapproved.,Matter of fact, my brother,and I were once walking,and he crossed the street,because there was a gay bar,and he said we should,not even walk near it.,Then mostly I was like, what is a gay bar?,I didn't even know.,My mom and my sister freaked out.,They both made it clear that,it was an unholy abomination.,And, I was gonna go to hell.,My mom was like, if you're not,gonna live within God's rules,you're gonna have to leave my house.,You gotta go, you gotta leave.,I moved into this period,of time where then,I just started questioning,everything I had learned.,(people protesting, yelling),- [Desireena] Years,earlier, across an ocean,,a generation of Germans,were loudly questioning,everything that they had learned, as well.,- [Woman] You know what kind,of pigs we're up against.,This is the Auschwitz generation.,How can we allow them,to murder in our name?,Americans, out of Vietnam.,- [Desireena] The Red Army Faction,was just one of many leftist groups,,born out of the protest,movements of the 1960s.,- [Woman] We have had enough,of providing the veneer of democracy.,- [Desireena] In Europe and America,,the far left showed their affinity,for Marxist revolutions,taking place in Vietnam,,Cuba, Venezuela, and,elsewhere in the world,by, as they put it, bringing the war home.,(drumming music),They believed that,capitalism was the main cause,of oppression and inequality worldwide.,American imperialists,were the chief enforcers,,and West Germany their,leading client state.,- [Woman] This is where we come from,,from the brainwashing of the media.,From consumerism, from the,ideology of powerlessness.,From depression, illness.,From all the exploited peoples,who are oppressed by imperialism.,(gun blasting),- [Man] If the police fire on,us again, we will shoot back.,People feel there's nothing to,be done about the situation.,But the struggle has begun!,- [Desireena] The RAF's actions,became increasingly more violent.,(hard driving music),Through nearly decades,,they robbed banks,,bombed prisons and U.S. military bases,,hijacked planes, took hostages,,and assassinated political,and financial leaders.,(intense music),They made America's Weather Underground,look like the Boy Scouts.,(music intensifies),The RAF was West Germany's,public enemy number one.,But to the far left, they were heroes.,They also became a political,,cultural, and media obsession.,(explosion and music drowns out singing),- [Desireena] Articles, documentaries,,fictionalized accounts.,Many members became household names.,Even Eddie's murder became shorthand.,You know, it was odd that,there was always this woman,as part of the murder.,I didn't really think much about it,,'cause I didn't think,she'd ever be captured.,And then in '93, she was arrested.,In 1996, when Birgit Hogefeld,was convicted of the crime,,it was 11 years after the crime,,and it didn't feel like it was,really gonna change anything.,I felt that little piece of satisfaction,,but what I was surprised to find out,was that it didn't really have,any better picture of what,had actually happened at the,end of my brother's life.,I knew that there were two,members of the Red Army Faction,in prison, 'cause I had read about them,on political prisoner websites.,And I didn't quite know,who this other woman was.,And that was Eva Haule.,She was convicted for,conspiracy to plant the bomb.,(birds chirping),Dear Miss Hogefeld, I hope,this letter finds you well.,I am Kathleen Pequeño and,I live in Portland, Oregon.,I am Edward Pimental's younger sister.,I was 15 when my brother died,,so I've lived most of my,life without him in it,,and I've come to the,point where I want to have,a different relationship to former members,of the Red Army Faction.,I'm not satisfied with the,resolution provided to us,by the criminal justice system,,in which we are all supposed,to go our separate ways.,You to prison, my family,to our invisible grief,on the outside.,(gentle music),I think that is incorrect and,counter to the sort of world,I want to live in.,If possible, I would,like to get to know you,,and to know how Eddie's,death has affected you,,your life, and your family,in the decades since.,- [Desireena] I followed,Kathleen to Chicago,,where was attending a conference.,She was also hoping to,meet with a former member,of an American leftist militant group,in preparation for her,first trip to Germany.,(phone ringing),Hi, is this Bill?,[Bill] Yup.,Hi Bill, this is Kathleen Pequeño.,We exchanged some email.,- [Desireena] Bill Ayers,,who was a leading member,of the Weather Underground,,an American group,that was roughly equivalent to the RAF.,[Bill] I'm terribly sorry about your loss,,I know it was a long time ago.,Thank you.,I'm sure it's still very raw. And,,You know, I doubt very much,that I can give you any help,,But, you know, I'm happy to say hi.,I mean basically I'm,putting out feelers to,various people who have some,proximity to armed struggle.,That's just, you know, and,so that would include you.,[Bill] Have you talked to Jeremy Varon?,Do you know Jeremy?,Um, I don't know him, and so he's,,I just added him to my list.,So do you have contact with him?,I have talked to him.,But he's a very nice, very,accessible young historian.,And our last talk he was,looking for a woman to date.,(laughs) Yeah, okay,,I don't know that I'll be,able to help him there.,He's a thoughtful guy,and he wrote this book,,about Baader Meinhof and Weathermen,,and I can't remember what else.,""Bringing the War Home."",He will probably know some,of the players involved.,He would know what exists,because he is a very serious historian.,That's great, you know, that,could be really helpful.,[Bill] But if I hear,anything I'll let you know.,I mean I doubt that I will, I,haven't over all these years.,But I'm sympathetic with,your desire to know more,and understand more about it.,I have to find Jeremy Varon.,- [Desireena] A month,later, we were in Brooklyn,to speak with Varon.,I asked Varon about the,political environment,that gave rise to the RAF.,Many members of the German left,saw contemporary forms of injustice,in post-war Germany as echoes,of the great injustices,of the Nazi regime.,Their view was that their parents,had been complicit in,the crimes of fascism,,or had done nothing to,stop the perpetration,of an enormous evil, so,for German activists,,the war in Vietnam was a,new instance of genocide.,Fighting against the Vietnam war,,they were in a sense fighting,against the legacy of Auschwitz.,The idea is that they would,rise to the moral challenge,of their time in a way that,their parents had failed.,Into the 1980s, the Red Army Faction,continued to try to strike directly,at members of the American military,,and then the tragic episode in 1985,in which Pimental was killed,is an expression of that mindset.,- [Desireena] Kathleen wanted to find out,what contacts Varon had,within the German left.,Who do you know that you might be able,to put me in touch with?,I know a researcher whose doing work,on some of the former prisoners,,and then I know a number,of historians of Germany,,both in Germany and the United States,,who have personal contact with,some of the former members.,But going back to your brother,,I mean you say that you want to meet them,without any sense of animosity,,but they after all were involved,in killing your brother.,That seems like a remarkably,gracious attitude to take.,Can you truly meet them,without any sense of animosity?,I think there's, I know,there are parts of this,I will get angry about all over again,,but it's not right or useful,to direct that anger at them.,Well is there a risk for,you in reopening old wounds?,Anything that was reopened,,I guess wasn't fully healed anyway,,and so for me it's an opportunity,to get to finish my healing process.,And for me, that's lifelong.,I'm gonna live my whole,life without my brother.,It's a way of being with him.,- [Kathleen] I mean, it's,the way he's in my life now.,At one level, he didn't matter to them.,He was incidental, he had,something useful to them,,and the great irony is that,you want to humanize them,in a way that they certainly,didn't humanize your brother.,I would be curious what their,political evolution was like,,and how they concocted a sense of mission.,But I don't want to go back,and have a 30-year-old argument.,I want a chance to get to know them,and figure out like, what,should we be doing now?,What do you see about the world now?,What did you learn about,it, being in prison?,What's the most pressing,work for us to be doing,for a better world now?,Okay, I mean, I'm a little confused,,because what unites you with them,is the murder of your brother.,What is special or important,about their perspective,on what needs to be done today,that you want to sort of get at?,I mean, they're not just any,social justice activists.,They're not, I mean, yeah.,Or any ex-prisoners, they're people,who were strong adherents of an ideology,that cost you and your,family an enormous amount.,My guess is that you're,separating now from then,in a way that is gonna prove,very difficult over time,because they're so deeply interconnected.,To me, I'm not necessarily going to be,doing anything like dissecting them,,around like, what led to,committing the murder?,I mean and it's based, I've had,a chance to meet and connect,with lots of people who've,done lots of horrible things,,by working with people,convicted of serious and violent crimes.,And I'm like right, if,they'd been thinking,,they wouldn't have done it.,But these people were thinking,,that they had a very well-developed,,if rigid, world view.,I'm pretty sure they were,kinda wrong if they thought,that killing my brother was,gonna end American imperialism.,I'm pretty sure most people,would say they're wrong now.,So I don't think it's end of story,,but I think the place for us,to connect is in the present.,I mean the place to figure out how,,we both had 25 plus years,to live with this murder,,and that's actually the place for me,,where I think there's,the most place to learn.,It seems like you don't,want from them contrition.,It would be very,understandable if you did.,It would be.,If some part of you would want to sort of,rattle their conscience,,(It would be useful.),and have them break down and come to terms,with the very real and,devastating pain that was caused,,and maybe have them apologize,and you offer forgiveness.,You don't want that,,or at least you say you don't want that.,It seems like you want to,see in them redemption,,not contrition, but redemption.,Who they are now, how their politics,have evolved and changed, the,good that they're trying to do,for the world, and then,redemption may well,be a part of their story.,But you seem so intent to,privilege redemption over guilt,,and what if they don't,seem all that contrite?,Will you be able to see them as redeemed?,- [Desireena] Varon put into words,something that was nagging at me.,Why was Kathleen so invested,in the lives of people,who had hurt her so deeply?,To try to make sense of all of this,,I spoke with Ellis Cose, author of a book,about forgiveness and reconciliation.,- Restorative justice is,basically the idea that,,and it's very much linked to,this whole idea of forgiveness,,that you somehow restore a person's,ability to function in society,and what they have lost,,as opposed to just be taking retribution,for something that has happened.,And often how you see it playing out,is that there are various organizations,and even societies which,encourage there to be interaction,between the perpetrators and the victims.,And a sense of understanding emerges,,and a sense of communicating the outrage,,the anger, the injury, and ideally,,being repaired for that in some way.,(soft music),- [Desireena] In her book, Birgit Hogefeld,had written eloquently,about her feelings of remorse,regarding Edward's death.,[Birgit] Today when I try to imagine,,to picture such a situation,,When I imagine that someone would go out,and shoot a young man dead,because he's a soldier in the US Army,,and he possesses an I.D. that they want,,then I find that gruesome and inhumane,in the deepest way possible.,And there were times in my,life when I could justify,the shooting death of a U.S. soldier,,or a car bomb on the air base,in Frankfurt or Ramstein,,or the Schleyer kidnapping.,Today I have a greater inner,distance from that attitude.,- [Desireena] Hogefeld had,written back to Kathleen,,acknowledging her loss, but,refusing to meet in person.,But we still hoped that,through another contact,,she would change her mind.,Gerold von Braunmuhl,was the right-hand man,to the German Minister of Foreign Affairs.,The RAF accused him of,strategizing in secret,to strengthen NATO,missile systems in Europe,,increasing the possibility,of a new Holocaust,,a nuclear one.,Two masked RAF members,shot Gerold in the head,in front of his house while,his daughter was home.,No one was ever convicted.,We met with Gerold's,brother, Carl Christian.,He himself had met several,times with Hogefeld,,so we asked him why he thought,she might be unwilling,to meet with Kathleen.,Whatever Birgit Hogefeld,did or did not do,,surely it is extremely likely that,she knows a great deal about,how Kathleen's brother died.,And she is firm in her,decision, as she has been,from the start, to keep,silent on the issue.,She does not want to speak about it.,She doesn't...,want to burden anyone.,She doesn't want to betray anyone.,And it's very possible that she thinks,Kathleen wants to hear how it was.,How it was and who it was.,And that is exactly what,she doesn't want to say.,After Eddie died, I realized,what it really means to kill people,,and I was like oh, I will,never be able to do that.,Sorry.,And we'd always grown,up talking about war,,but not really understanding it.,Shoot.,Mostly what happened was that,,well, I think mostly my,mother was really sad,,and mostly I was really angry.,I just assumed these people were monsters,and not human beings.,Sometimes in the years since,all of this has unfolded,,my biggest frustration with my family,has been wanting to say to them,,have you learned nothing?,Yeah, because once we learned this,,once we had experienced this,,how could you ever wish this on,,how could you ever,think this would be okay,for another family?,When people are in a narrow,,ideological cage,,that's a form of,,well, dogmatism is like a mild illness.,And totalitarianism is a severe illness.,The important question is,,How does a person get,into that narrow cage,,and how does he maybe get out of it again?,And I think that terrorists,,that is, perpetrators,and victims, in general,,when they talk to each other,,they can do tremendous things,that no one else can do,,towards making it stop.,- [Desireena] By the end of our trip,,there was no response from Hogefeld,,and I still couldn't fully comprehend,Kathleen's motivations.,(soft music),But when I went with her to meet a man,she had worked with in prison,,their genuine affection,for each other moved me.,They met in 1997 in a,maximum security prison.,John Castro was serving 25 years to life,for murdering his stepfather,,a man who he believed was,sexually abusing his sisters.,Kathleen was working for,a nonprofit organization,,and was asked to take on a,project in the prison system,,where she got to know John.,After 21 years in prison, John,was finally granted parole,and released last year.,I saw the pictures that were posted,on your trip to Berlin,,but there wasn't a whole lot,of conversation about it.,I know, I've never actually,met with other people,who had someone,killed by the same group.,It's strange to have that,in common with someone.,- [John] You know the,ladies that you were trying,to come across over there in Germany,,what kind of connections,have you made with them?,They're not that interested,in meeting with me.,Or even talking to me, so.,Did they say what their reluctance was?,Yeah one of the women,has never answered me.,The other one, I think she's,worried it's not gonna go well.,I wish they could talk to some,of the people I know here,,be like, no, she really will,just keep showing up for you.,Yeah, but you know what,,that's what you need to do sometimes.,- [Kathleen] I know.,You need to just keep showing up,,and at some point in time,,something can happen.,Still easier to show up when,it's not 6,000 miles away.,- [John] Well then move there.,(Kathleen chuckles),At this point I'm like,,I'm gonna try and go there,once a year and just keep letting,them know that I'm coming.,You know, see what comes of it.,Did you ever tell people how,much I broke out into a sweat,with you in our first interview?,- [Kathleen] 'Cause I,was so big and tough?,'Cause you were so big and tough.,- [Kathleen] I made the convicts sweat?,Yep, here I dealt with all,them crazy guys in there,and didn't blink an eye,,but when you walked in,,I got more self-conscious.,You know you were probably,the first individual,that I had communicated,with in that fashion,while I was in prison.,- [Kathleen] Like someone,coming in from the outside,just to talk to you,about something? (Yeah.),Alrighty.,There we go.,Well thank you for coming,,and we'll see you again.,I know, you know I'll see you again.,(soft music),- [Desireena] As time passed,,Kathleen moved back to,New York to get married,,and her search for former,RAF members was put on hold.,Three years later, our,quest came back to life,when I found Annett Zupke, a,restorative justice facilitator,based in Berlin.,Hi.,Hi, Annett.,- [Annett] So whom did,you write, Hogefeld?,I wrote to Hogefeld, and...,And what did she respond?,She responded with a certain openness,to talking with me, she's,always been respectful,,and we had a brief email correspondence,,but yeah, she's basically not,interested in meeting with me.,So she explicitly said,that she's not interested,in meeting you?,- [Kathleen] Yes.,Okay.,Yeah, and then Eva,Haule, who was connected,to the crime later, she,has never answered at all.,So frankly, I got a little,kinda stuck. (laughs),And I've wondered,about doing some sort,of surrogate dialogue.,People have mentioned that to,me, restorative justice folks.,I mean, what do you think about that?,I don't know.,One of my questions would be,,what is that you're hoping for?,Or what are questions you have,where you believe only they,could be answering them?,I want to know that I have,excavated whatever is there,that keeps me from being,able to think of them,as fully human.,And that having a real life person,would force me to do,different parts of that.,I recently was thinking,if there's one thing,that you and those women,from the RAF have in common,,then it's a dream to live,in a different world.,And to contribute to a different world.,The means that they chose,created a lot of harm,,but maybe trying to connect around this,,this desire to having,an impact into the world,and create something differently,,if you find words for that,and make your intention more visible.,(intense violin music),- [Desireena] Back in Germany,,two former revolutionaries,with ties to the RAF,have come forward,through Annett's network,,and are willing to meet with Kathleen.,The first is a woman we'll call Vera.,- [Kathleen] Hi, there.,So are we sitting at a table?,(speaking in German),Hello Kathleen, nice to meet you.,It's good to meet you.,Let's sit.,What spot is mine?,Just choose. I would like to sit here.,Yeah, yeah, I'll sit over there.,Because I feel comfortable.,- [Kathleen] So I don't want to pry,,but anything you want to tell,me about your experience,,I would like to hear.,My parents were young,in the 1930s and 40s,,my father was in the army,,And when I came to know,about the German history,,I was 13 or 15, I asked them,,what have you done during the war?,And they said, we didn't know anything.,Sorry.,It was so shocking for me.,That I decided I would never allow,developments like this again in Germany.,And my parents always kept saying,they hadn't known what was going on,,especially about the,destruction of the Jewish people,and the concentration camps.,Later I came to know,about the Vietnam War.,This was a thing I thought,,this couldn't be right.,I went to a lot of,demonstrations and teach-ins.,Then the police came with water and sticks,and hit us.,And then some people started,to throw stones at the police.,The police get more arms,,and then there were more stones,,and the police get guns,and things like that.,- [Desireena] Participating in,an action to free a comrade,,the group shot a prison guard.,Vera was later caught and,spent 11 years in prison.,Do you feel anything like regret,for the actions that took you to prison?,No.,My involvement in these,things was voluntary.,No one forced me into anything.,I'm prepared to deal with the,consequences of what I did.,And maybe it's my good luck,that I didn't kill anybody in those years.,But still, there were,certainly some injuries,,physical as well as emotional, of course.,Maybe ""regret"" isn't really,the best word after all.,Because I am sorry, my,standpoint today is yes,,I am sorry that because of the movement,and the part I played in,it, other people got hurt.,What I do have is a,willingness to deal with it,,And work through it,,like the way we're sitting here right now.,You know, parts of this are very hard,,but then other times it's,easy to just remember,that you're, we don't,have the same experience,,but you're not that different from me.,And so, yeah.,But it's hard to hold onto both sometimes.,I can imagine this.,(sad piano music),- [Desireena] On one of our free days,,Kathleen and I decided to tour,an old East German prison.,Walking through the cells,,I was reminded of Eva Haule,,the woman who had spent 21 years in prison,for conspiracy in Eddie's murder.,[Eva] How should one describe it,,when in prison day in and day out,over years and years,,one always sees the same,thing, walks the same paths?,It reduces the gaze; numbs,one; rots the senses.,Photography opens up the gaze again.,The women that I have photographed,are in their own way very strong.,They fight their way through life,,and try to go their own way,and maintain their dignity.,What some people have,said is that Eva Haule,has no regrets, has no opinion,that anything the group did was wrong.,That every killing was justified.,- [Desireena] Show me, where she is?,She's back here.,- [Desireena] Later that week,,Vera met with Kathleen again.,This time, to show her the,drawings she had made in prison.,There was one other former revolutionary,to meet on this trip.,His name was Axel Waeldele.,(guns blasting),(people shouting),- [Reporter] Good evening from Paris,,the capital city of a country,that is tonight mourning the victims,of the worst terrorist attack,in Europe for 10 years.,- [Desireena] Kathleen's,meeting with Axel Waeldele,happened to take place the day,after the Paris terrorist attacks.,So mostly last night,,I was just really sad.,And I just have this sense,that what I'm actually doing,with these dialogues doesn't matter.,Why, or where does this feeling come from,that it doesn't really matter?,Just that war is so seductive.,And that every time this happens,,more people just get pulled in.,Yes, this trend is hard to stop, but,,there are many hopeful things.,That you are in a place,to sit down with me,with such openness and,meet me in this way,,even though,,I was connected to a group,that caused you a lot of pain.,- [Facilitator] Would you like to share,what's going on for,you when you hear that?,I'm just a little overwhelmed.,I wanted to know more about,how you were affected,,if you were affected, by the events,at Rhein-Main and my brother's,,and the other Americans, U.S.-ers, deaths.,What I remember vividly was that there was,a controversial discussion in our group,,Because there were some people,,with whom I didn't agree,,they said,,that they really found it horrible,,to kill someone in order to get their I.D.,And so for me the action on the air base,was part of a strategy,that had already existed,for quite a while.,That's why I saw the decision,by the RAF to take this step,,so to speak,,to go to another stage of this war...,It felt right.,I see many things differently today,,but I would like to try to,explain how it was for me then.,My question was,,your brother decided to work in the army,,be part of a professional army.,And one aim of that army is,to learn to kill and wage war.,And he was confronted with,that kind of violence.,I mean, my brother was trained for that.,If he had really believed it,,he wouldn't have just,struck up a conversation,with a random German,person and left with them.,In this particular action,,it depended on the idea,that he would be a young trusting person.,That he would not agree with the training,that told him to treat everyone,like a potential enemy.,(News report in German),- [Desireena] Upon our return to the U.S.,,news broke that three,known members of the RAF,who had never been caught,had been implicated,in several robberies in,the north of Germany.,As I pondered this new,development, I received a message,from Kathleen's estranged,sister, Lisa Marie.,She wanted to talk to me about Kathleen,and the film I was making.,Every now and then, I research Kathleen,,'cause I don't trust the woman.,I don't know what she's up to,,so every now and then I'll,come across a blog of hers,,and I came across where she was sitting,,I believe in a window,,talking about Edward.,And a lot of it was fallacy.,I was told by somebody very special,that what is one person's mindset,can be somebody else's not truth.,So it could a half truth, it,could be an interpretation.,It could be a lot of things.,Being Edward's older sister,and only biological sister,,Kathleen being a half-child,,I felt that I needed to,set the record straight.,So I contacted you, 'cause I,wanted to know who you were,and how you got involved in the issue.,(soft music),- [Desireena] Lisa Marie's,reputation preceded her.,I had never met her, but I remembered,how she made Kathleen's life,hell back in high school.,Now, meeting her in person felt a little,like I was betraying my friend.,This is the flag from Edward's coffin.,It was a beautiful silver,coffin, flag-draped.,But, his memorial.,So after he was buried, this was...,After he was buried this,was handed to my mom.,My mom always wanted to keep,this tight in the family,,because she was afraid,of Edward's murderers.,And as I've come to find,,they have been released,,and Kathleen's perfectly okay with it.,Well they did their time.,But my mom is still doing her,time, 'til the day she died.,They're still alive,,they're still underground.,For the longest time, my,mom was in fear of them.,- [Desireena] You're,still in fear of them.,I'm still in fear of them.,There is, and still to this,day, a guerrilla action.,- [Desireena] You think,these people were...,These people are still part of it.,This is just a tidbit.,I'm sure there are a lot,more cogs in that wheel.,My mother, to her deathbed,,believed an eye for an eye.,At one point in time,,her anger and her fury,and her frustration of these people,getting a 20-year sentence killed her.,She wanted these people dead.,I don't understand Kathleen's reasoning,why she needs to meet these people.,They're never gonna tell her,why or what the reason was,,and that's one of the issues we have,,why we are no longer on speaking terms.,- [Desireena] If you somehow,were able to talk to them,and speak to them...,I would tell them what,they took from my family.,- [Desireena] What would you say?,They took a nice kind young man,and destroyed a mother and her parents,,and his siblings, and all,the friends who knew him.,But there's really not,much more to say about it.,It's done, it's over,,he's a wonderful memory.,He will always be a wonderful memory.,Edward, where are you?,Yeah he's somewhere, up here,somewhere, I don't remember.,This is sad. (laughs),I got Q8.,- [Desireena] Did you find him?,No, I found Q8.,Edward, come out wherever you is.,Here we go, bingo.,Long may she wave.,That's the reason our boys,go to war, to protect her.,- [Desireena] Deciding to make,Lisa Marie a part of the film,presented some issues.,Kathleen was not happy.,(Kathleen speaking indistinctly),- [Desireena] So I have other questions,related to Lisa Marie,,and I know it puts you,in a difficult situation,,because you don't want,me to be, the go-between.,I've got enough problems without that.,But I just have questions.,I mean, that's the hard part.,This is obviously, like,,we could turn my family,into a sideshow, we're like,a soap opera, you know,,with various, and as you've seen,,like various hidden things,,and things that no one talks,about 'cause they're so loaded,,and it is a distraction.,- [Desireena] From what?,From things that actually matter.,I mean, it certainly,informs my life experience,about how we address harm and,how we deal with addiction,,and how we deal with the truth.,Do you think there's a possibility,of a different story with Lisa Marie?,I will, I mean I hope to,never close that door.,But that said, I'm not the doormat,that one steps on to get through it.,- [Desireena] What would,it take on your part,,in terms of what needs to happen?,No more screaming at me, no more threats.,No more threats directed at my loved ones.,No more telling me you're,sticking pins in a doll,you've made shaped of,me, things like that.,Is she still contacting you?,Is she still leaving messages?,I haven't had any,contact in quite a while.,Yeah, but I also like, I,mean I have some concerns,around physical safety, 'cause,she is just so unpredictable.,I guess for me it's starting to be stark,,in terms of like, this huge,desire, need on your part,to try to meet with people,who killed your brother,,and it's quite a contrast, right,,in terms of, you really don't,want to have anything to do,with your sister, who is here in New York.,I feel like there's really some sort,of connection there, right, like...,So part of me, and the difference is,,is that I know that I care about her.,I know that I love her,,and I know that I know her,and her struggles, and that I have,a context for it greater than the hurt.,I understand where the,two situations seem like,,oh, but why are, they're,both, they're all people,who have done something,that's kind of hurtful,,so why are they so different?,Part of the answer is I have,a fuller picture of my sister.,So you're you giving these two women,the benefit of the doubt,because you don't know them?,Well I give them the benefit of the doubt,to a certain extent.,To a certain extent, they're kind of,these shadowy outlines of people,,and that's what I want to shift.,So, it's a chance to,see people more fully.,What if you could either,reconcile with your sister,,or reconcile with the people in Germany?,But you had to make that choice.,Yeah, I don't think that's,how it works at all.,'Cause I think part of,the trick here is that,,I think part of the trick is,,we figure out how to,reconcile whatever we can,,and then it opens doors to figure out,how to reconcile on something else.,What will it help me to figure out?,That could help me then figure out,something with this,conflict with my sister,,which is actually much older.,Much older and I have,much more responsibility,in the conflict with my sister.,I know there are places,where I've let her down.,And I'm sad for it, you know?,That she needed me to,figure some things out,,even with the damaged,relationship that we had,,she needed me to figure out some things,that I could not figure out,,and that I could not,actually act as her ally,when she was desperately in need of one.,And it would have been great,if we could have figured,that out, but we didn't.,- [Desireena] Back in Germany,,a prominent ex-member of,the RAF has agreed to talk,,but does not want to be filmed.,I'm responsible for having killed,,collective, two people.,And this is not easy, to live with.,- [Kathleen] Some people say, oh,,it's bad that your brother died,,but the 35 other people killed,by the RAF, that was okay.,And so I wanted to understand,more from your perspective,,if you make that same distinction?,No, no, no. I don't think that,the killing of your brother,was wrong and the others was right. No.,That's not my opinion.,The killing of the embassy,,the people employed,,was a, you can't make a,better society on this basis.,By killing hostages.,I had doubts.,From the beginning.,But I felt as a revolutionary,,this was the ideology.,It was the thinking of that time.,Sometimes violence is, is, is,,is necessary.,- [Kathleen] But here's,the thing about violence,,is that I don't think that the question,of whether a particular act of violence,is right or wrong is useful.,What I think sometimes is more important,is to ask ourselves, are you,willing to pay the price,,yourself, for what this,violence will cost someone else?,If you're going to say,,like, well I'm doing this,and it's right, are you so,convinced that it's right,that you'll pay to make that,other person whole again?,You can't explain it a little bit more?,- [Kathleen] When people,do violence to each other,,afterwards, someone needs to clean it up.,Someone needs to help someone heal.,Similarly with the Red Army Faction,,sometimes I think, okay,,so you have your reasons,,but what are you gonna,do then for my mother?,Which, it's kind of late now.,But my mother carried that burden,,probably more than anyone.,So, um.,What, what,,perhaps it's a naive question.,What would your mother,expect that we do for her?,- [Kathleen] Oh I don't think,my mother expected anything.,But what you do, what you think we...,- [Kathleen] My mother,was a working class woman.,She worked, she came home, she,was tired, she went to sleep.,She worked as what?,- [Kathleen] She was a bartender.,She just didn't have any, like,she couldn't take time off,when my brother died.,She had to start going right,back to work right away.,So she buried my brother and,then she was back to work.,And she eventually lost that job,,maybe six or seven years later.,She needed that money.,- [Kathleen] She did,,but what they said to her,when they let her go, was,,""You were never the same,after your son died."",But she never had a,regular job after that,,for the rest of her life.,- [Desireena] With her,mom grieving the loss,of her only son, Kathleen,was having to grow up fast.,And I was feeling like I couldn't keep up.,I remember it clearly,now, the exact moment,when we began drifting apart.,Walking home through the park,,Kathleen blurted out a family secret,that we would never speak,of again, until now.,- [Kathleen] So growing up there,was never any father around,and I didn't ask very,many questions about it.,They were just like, he was a bad man,,and you're better off without him.,And then the night before Eddie's wake,,my mom sat me down and she's like,,I have something I have to tell you.,And I think she just started,off by describing her marriage,to this man who I thought was my father,,and she was like, it was,a very brutal marriage.,And then she started to see that it had,a negative effect on my siblings.,And out of concern for them,,she realized that she had to leave.,She had these two kids, she,was living with her parents.,She was like, there were,all these things happening.,It was beginning of the sexual revolution,,and I wanted to be in it, and,she was working at a hotel.,That's what my mother did,for actually most of her working life.,And one evening she met some man,who was traveling through,,and he was really interesting,,and he asked her to go on a date,,so she said yes and,she was really excited.,But pretty much the start of the date,was him forcing her to have sex with him.,He raped her, and then she was like,,I just have to get out of here.,And then within a few months,,she realized she was pregnant.,You know, what's funny is,,later I read in journals,about things like restorative justice,or transformative justice, and it becomes,this fancy concept that,people think of, I think.,But I'm like, that was,actually the first time,I really saw it, you know.,That my mom was like, I got to choose.,I couldn't choose what,happened, but I picked you.,I picked you and then I decided,what sort of relationship,I would have with you.,And I don't have to minimize what happened,and how horrible it was to do that.,Both things are possible.,- [Desireena] At the,beginning of this project,,I told myself a story about how Kathleen,drifted away after her brother died.,Now, I'm realizing what,really happened back then.,When she revealed to me that,she was a child of rape,,I was mute; I was ashamed for her.,And I was embarrassed for my reaction.,And so, I slowly tiptoed away.,Now it began to dawn on me, on,this latest trip to Germany,,the reason I'd been looking for Kathleen,since we lost touch after high school.,In our final push to find,people willing to talk,,one woman came forward.,Before her meeting with,Kathleen, I spoke to Monika,,because I was curious to know more,about her personal history.,My father was in the Nazi Party,,and during the denazification,he was classified,as a so-called follower,,But the whole atmosphere,when I was growing up,,in the crucial development years,,it was permeated with,fascism and post-fascism.,It had always been presented,to us as if fascism just fell,from the sky and went straight,to hell, or vice versa.,I never knew where fascism came from.,We never heard anything about that.,And then I saw: it's,built into the system.,For me, it was a shattering,experience to recognize that,the regular institutions,that I myself used,and took part in,,That they were also part,of this fascist process.,- [Desireena] It was this realization,that moved Monika towards,revolutionary action.,I had always felt I was at a disadvantage,,especially as a woman.,That I could never truly,do what I wanted to do.,And in the RAF, with the people there,,it was not just about,liberation for women,,Although it was part of it; it was about,liberation in general, and,I liked that even better.,- [Desireena] Why were you arrested?,Well there were several, arrests.,The first time.,- [Desireena] The first time, yeah.,Well there was this apartment,,an underground apartment,of ours was discovered.,The police got wind of it, you know,,and we never figured out,exactly how that happened.,Probably someone ratted us out.,- [Desireena] Monika,was initially sentenced,to 12 years for a bank robbery,,but in a daring attempt two years later,,she escaped from prison,with three other women.,Was it easy to escape?,We have this saying: ""There's,no weapon of the enemy's,that you cannot turn against them."",And it worked very well for us.,- [Desireena] Monika was,subsequently recaptured,,spending a total of 18 years in prison,and participating in 10 hunger strikes.,In the slammer you're,completely powerless you know.,With the hunger strikes, you notice that,you can have an effect.,You're the subject again.,Acting, to act on your,own, to be the subject,,that was very important.,Otherwise, in the meantime,,you forget, you remain,,you start to identify that way.,You get used to just,being an object, you know.,- [Desireena] So it was a way for you,to take control of the only,thing you could control,,right, your body?,Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.,I think the longest of those was seventy,,a little over seventy days.,- [Desireena] I can't even,imagine what that was like.,I can't imagine how it was,to not eat for 70 days.,It was difficult. (laughs),- [Translator] It's difficult.,(Laughter),- [Desireena] That's all you can say,about it, right, okay.,You are constantly hungry.,It's not true that you're no longer hungry,after the first week. You,are constantly hungry.,- [Desireena] What was,it that you were trying,to achieve with the RAF?,You wanted to change the world, correct?,It was always clear to us,that there will be long,and contradictory struggles,,And we will try to spark this struggle,,to get it going,,So that people can rise up,,that humanity can rise up,,And then, replace what we have now,,which is profoundly unjust,,with something better.,- [Desireena] You know, when,I started doing this film,,it was hard for me to imagine,,deciding to go underground,and committing illegal actions,in the name of freedom, right?,But now we have a fascist,president in the U.S.,,and it's making much more,sense to learn from your story.,What are the useful,ways that you resisted?,And what were the mistakes you made?,One of the things that I still think about,and probably will never,stop puzzling over,,is how something that was,a positive thing at first,,in my opinion anyway,,and was initiated with,the best of intentions,,could somehow then change,so completely and terribly.,I do say there was,certainly a lot that I did,that was wrong, without question.,But of course I always think too,,How far can I say to,myself that I have erred?,And could I have done things better?,I mean it's always very hard,,it's a continuous process, and,it's never completely over.,- [Desireena] Perhaps this,discussion with Kathleen,is part of it, part of the process?,Maybe, yes? (laughs),- [Translator] Maybe.,I think my curiosity is about how you see,your decisions influencing other people,,because you're one of the early members,,and some people who thought,they were following your example,killed my brother.,And this is exactly the point.,Therefore I am responsible,,I feel a bit responsible.,Even though I wasn't,participating and found it wrong.,Despite this I want to talk,to you, to clarify this.,- [Annett] And this is the,point, even though I wasn't,participating in that, I,kind of feel responsible.,There is a piece and part of me,that feels a little responsible.,And that's why I want to talk to you.,I want to share things.,(speaking in German),Yeah.,Uh.,Huh.,- [Annett] Speak, was there a question,or confusion or something?,No, I'm like, that's why we should talk.,I find it difficult with all of this...,Yeah, we might need this,to be a little more subtle.,- [Desireena] To ease the tension,,we moved to a more intimate setting.,What I feel very aware of is not wanting,to assign responsibility,to you that is not yours.,And also recognize that you,are one of the architects,of the thinking that led,people to decide it was okay.,I was a relatively,""small light"" as we say,,I don't mean to diminish,my responsibility,,But she shouldn't think I,was one of the spokespersons,,or prominent leaders.,But I never made it a secret,,That I do not have regrets, or something.,So, yeah, so I just,think I want to be clear,on two different things and how,you see them going together,,that on the one hand you have no regrets,,but that you also,recognize that this group,,once you were less active with it,,was involved in killing,all these different people.,Yeah.,But you see those as,two, those go, how's it,,so I'm like, you don't,regret that part at all?,I can't regret. Regret is,not a political concept.,Do you understand?,It is from morals, from theology,,I did what I did.,I can say it was wrong. That I can say.,But I can't regret it.,Then I would negate myself.,- [Kathleen] Yeah,,Do you understand?,Yeah, then there's that, I mean, um.,(speaking in German),- [Annett] I mean, I did it, it was me.,No matter what, it was me,But the politics don't,,the politics did not kill my brother.,I'm not looking for anyone,to renounce the politics.,It's frustrating to me, whenever people,,when they talk about a murder,,are always like, well who's who?,Because they want to decide if they agree,with the person who did the killing,or the person who was killed.,It was the same for us.,Without wanting to justify that.,Many of us felt the same way.,I mean, how many of the,RAF have been killed?,Yeah.,A lot of my friends were killed.,Yeah.,Do you want to say,anything else about that?,- [Annett] (speaking in German),About that?,No.,(soft sad music),So I'm curious to understand,more about you personally,becoming part of the RAF,when you were a young woman.,But not just like,politically, like personally.,Why did you want to do it?,I really ask for,understanding, that I'm not,,I talked about this,extensively this morning,,And I'm really sorry,But I don't feel like,repeating this all again.,Let me think about it.,I wanted to kind of start to move,towards the harder questions by asking...,(speaking in German),- [Annett] And she now,says, well why don't you,just go ahead with the more,difficult questions right away?,Okay, um, so, sure, let's try that.,So when we were talking yesterday,,we were talking about how,one thing we had in common,was knowing people who had died.,So what was your experience,like the first time,someone you knew who was,part of the RAF died?,It was awful.,I don't know. I can't say much about it.,I don't want to spread my,emotions here. I don't want to.,It was...,But we also knew it.,We also knew that someone could die.,That was absolutely clear.,We didn't want it to happen.,That was not our intention, that someone,,but that was the,decision, that this is war,and in this war people could die.,So, yeah, what else would,you like me to know, Monika?,'Cause I can't tell. (chuckles),Do you know what that means?,- [Annett] I just want to make sure,,and you ask that, because you,know she came for a reason,,she wanted to share something with you,,and you'd rather want her to express,what she wants to share?,Yeah, and now I've asked,her two specific questions,and on both, she's kind of basically said,I'm not really gonna,tell you, so I'm like,,I can't tell then what we're here for.,I can't think of anything,right now. I think,,because I wasn't the one who,brought up the initiative.,It wasn't like I said, ""I want,to speak about something."",I heard she is here, and,that she talks about it,,And I was asked so I,said, ""Okay, I'm coming."",I also see it as my,responsibility to do that.,But she initiated.,Maybe we're closer to done than I thought.,- [Annett] How are you feeling right now?,Yeah I mean, uh.,More discouraged than I thought.,- [Annett] Can I ask you something?,- [Kathleen] Mm-hmm.,You started off with asking Monika,how yesterday was for,her, and I don't know,,do you still want to,share how it was for you?,It was harder than I,thought to talk with you.,It was harder than I thought it would be.,Uh huh.

,strength relax relax perhaps perhaps there ,is some way before the candle flickers lower,that i may impress upon him the dire ,consequences of his love for the girl,have you been talking to him about velder and me ,i'll be silly there's no knowledge he could give,me that i do not already possess you in love with ,the creature who you believe in three short years,has cleansed her blood of the primitive instincts ,reared by the gorilla tribe mothered by baboons,and yet you would not believe that someday her ,soft caresses could turn into hairy steel claws,around your throat i know of which i speak ,and feel the words must cut you like a blade,but i too once reached for forbidden love and ,brought upon myself the curse of the llama,you see the results now if you must go into ,the jungle leave her there easy leave her,leave her for the beast from when she came ,if we go into the jungle it won't be to,leave elder there it would be to satisfy a ,silly whim of my brothers cut it out jack,velda told me what you did and i appreciate ,it but call her what you will gorilla girl a,jungle creature it makes no difference we ,love each other perhaps my words will not,bear fruit nor if they do will you heed them i ,can only ask that you grant me this last request,i was young then and impetuous as you are,a maharaja a man of great ,estate on a hunting expedition,go a week in this wilderness and not ,one shot not a sign of anything moving,did not the mightiest of hunters could unassure ,his maharaja that these were the best jungles,in all the east it is impossible to explain ,your highness many times i have passed this,way as a traveler never without seeing hundreds ,of animals is it possible they've been killed,or perhaps died of natural causes this ,forest has never been hunted your highness,it's it's almost as if as a port as if the beast ,sensed they were being hunted and and all had fled,then my hunter would have me to believe that ,these wild beasts distinguish between the peaceful,travelers and the maharaja of diary who shoots ,them for sport that that would make them different,than any animals i have ever hunted perhaps ,your highness if if we pursued them this way,(Sounds of the Jungle),(Dramatic Music),thou art indeed kind my child,wait,may the blessings of the three deities bring ,you good fortune and good hunting holy men,you have great knowledge of ,all things i am very humble,there is something we wish to know why ,no game appears in the sights of your gun,how did you know you are not the first to try the ,hunting in this jungle all return home empty head,and you assured me the game was plentiful more so ,than in any jungle in the east ah but the game is,here in plenty but unless you come in peace you ,will never be aware of it how do you explain that,the holy man told us of this boy who ,was reared by the animals such as velda,he was their law their protector and so long as we ,remained in this jungle we were subject to his law,if we disobeyed a curse would fall upon us and a ,member of our party would die the son of a great,prince who traveled this jungle years ago the ,baby was reared by the animals so the people say,he has become a brother to them have you ,seen him i have seen him thank you holy man,what is your wish highness do you believe,there may be something in what he says ,we'll camp here tonight and tomorrow,from the moment i saw ronnie nothing ,else mattered but my desire for her,all thoughts of my hunt vanished ,even the warning of the holy one,which a moment before had sounded ,foreboding was now of little or no,importance,holy man that girl who brought your food who is ,she the daughter of rajan leader of our village,and her name rani of good character and ,greek beauty find this rajan and bring him,to my tent tonight yes and let us hope you ,are better at hunting men than wild beasts,it may not sound plausible to you of the western ,world but the projected thought of a holy llama,could have brought the disaster that was to befall ,us you mean the sabu fella was reared by animals,not only was he reared by them but he lived ,with them as one he was so much an animal that,he not only shared their thoughts but he spoke ,their language this curse would you explain it,there is a law of the jungle which ,allows one to partake for necessity,but the product that belongs must remain,perhaps i was ruthless but i loved ,ronnie as much as you love velvet,and i would let nothing sabu or the curse ,prevent me from obtaining that which i sought,i waited for quran to bring the girl's father to ,me this is rajan highness you are improving quran,perhaps we will find an animal yet after all you ,wished my presence highness what is your price,highness for your daughter's hand ronnie i wish ,to marry her the daughter of a number man such,as myself this is indeed the highest of honors ,well i have no price it is impossible no price,she is not married she is betrothed if i had but ,no highness if i could have anticipated oh and i,suppose you're a man of honor who cannot go back ,on his bargain even if i restore the man his goods,and make you wealthy beyond your greatest dreams,perhaps there is a way yes my son-in-law ,to be caddo is away on a pilgrimage to the,mountain shrine perhaps if i've received word ,that he had been killed by a tiger a tiger,in these jungles and if the wedding were to ,take place quickly when kedley returned we,would be very sorry a mistake but too late ,to correct your wise man rajan interested,in the daughter's happiness pay him his price ,whatever it is and bring the girl to me tomorrow,oh father good your curry is just ready i'm ,afraid my appetite is not so good little one,i bring you bad news bad news could ,they say he never reached the mountains,on the jungle trail,a tiger,he's dead i know it is terrible little one ,but i bring good news also my little daughter,is to be the bride of the maharaja ,it is all ranged little one,imagine the daughter of the ,house of rajan a princess,the deities are indeed kind in this hour of our ,sorrow no reni i will not i cannot marry cuddle,i marry no one i would rather die let the tiger ,that towards flesh tear mine too ronnie granny,and that's the story highness she ran into ,the jungle perhaps she is already dead if she,encounters no more animals than we in our hunting ,she is perfectly safe besides a lone girl in the,jungle should not be too hard to pursue hey quran ,not at all highness i could follow her anywhere,but suppose she encountered sabu your ,hunters would be no magic silence,the jungle boy interferes too often organize ,a search party take as many men as you need,and i prefer my bride to be alive yes highness ,ronnie was determined in her desire to escape,any possibility of marriage with me she did ,not fear the terrors of the jungle it seemed,if only she could succeed in ,eluding me or my party members,it may be that she was frightened but trusted to ,a hope of finding either sabu or her own cuddle,i had ever faith in kuran oh i was confident he ,would track down the girl but i did not have the,slightest hope we would ever capture the jungle ,boy did you in due time but not before ronnie,told him of my presence and my intent he belonged ,to her kind i didn't i had convinced myself that,quran's death was accidental all my men ,were killed or maimed but i was spared,for even a much worse faith,my empire was shattered easy i was left penniless ,and i wandered from continent to continent,selling my services as a professional guide to ,other hunters i had come to the belt country with,an expedition that would take me deep into gorilla ,country i had left the main party and was alone,but the fascination of the hairy ,beast drove all caution from my mind,a premonition of impending danger kept reminding ,me of the old llama's curse but even so i found,myself getting further and further from the main ,party perhaps i was foolhardy going into the,country of the bush gorilla that beast whom even ,the lion leaves along but i wanted a shot at one,i found the guerrilla tracks and followed them ,for several miles without locating the animal,from the sign i knew it must be a ,huge one and my blood began to pound,hmm,hmm,all right,ah,uh,when i fully regained my senses ,i saw her beside the gorilla,where she came from i did not know and at ,first i thought she was but no it couldn't,be i tore my glance from her i wanted my rifle ,because i was in a desperate situation thank you,you know the rest sahib doctor we ,delivered the girl into your custody,you have been ministering to my ailing health ever ,since i wish you all the blessings of the deities,not the curse of the jungle there is no ,cursive jungle except to him who disobeys,didn't i tell you to keep her home cyril ,look i tried i'm taking you back to that,vel did not go until old man die ,get her out of here let her remain,her kind sense the odor of death for many days ,she has known this hour was coming look arthur,maybe there's still time why don't we take him ,to the hospital there is not time she is right,there is very little time left i ,wish to breathe my last in the open,uh i can see by the look in your eye,nothing will prevent your trek into the jungle ,perhaps in my absence i can still be with you,reach into my pocket,my pocket,what is it it's the eye of the jungle ,when i fled the land of sabu i found it,and that shrunken head among my possessions there ,was an omen when the curse of the jungle is atoned,only then can it be returned to the place ,from once it came i don't understand,there are many things in the east that are ,secrets and cannot be comprehended by you,people from the western world what do you want me ,to do with them take it with you on your journey,perhaps it will perhaps it will ,influence your actions perhaps even,my eternity what about the head leave ,the head here it is a symbol of death,many times i have tried to lose it but it always ,reappears in the eye what if it never returns,to believe,is to be,have faith,so now these are the laws of the jungle and many ,in mighty are they for the head and the hoof,or the law and the haunch is obeyed,and now we had started on the safari i ,kept thinking of pasta the oh maharaja,the eye of the jungle the shrunken head,i marvel about the wonders of this dark ,continent this land of many contrasts for a,few short miles could take you from thriving ,modern cities into uncharted treacherous,wilderness i've been in africa a dozen ,or more years i knew its people in its,dark mysterious ways i was not ,exactly new to the jungle either,and yet there was something entirely ,different from any other trip i had made,i knew it was because of velvet animals which ,ordinarily run or attack at the sight of a human,intrusion seemed docile friendly curious it was as ,though they recognized belda as one of their own,as we continued on i wondered about ,the old heredity environment angle as,bella's thrust further into a jungle ,surroundings which you revert to a,former self or would she remain a white ,girl i kept telling myself i had to know,we spent the night on the brink of the zambezi ,river next morning cyril and i are up and once,more marveling at the glories of this weird ,country jack and bella saw it too but on a,different light are you happy with the safari ,folder much happy you're not worried or scared,well they're not scared nothing hurt me this is my ,country your country is beautiful very beautiful,it's gonna be hard to leave but you ,like our country america when we go,check not go always stay with velda ,here of course i'll never leave you,builder how do you think of me,jack lavelda thought i love jack and ,protect him too jack's a lucky guy,but he also likes a kiss now and then ,oh velda got many kisses for jack,set me up for air selda like,see my brother a minute,africa is a fascinating country kind ,of overwhelms a fellow doesn't it,we were not aware when the drums began to ,beat but as we watched belden i knew the,rhythm and this weird dance something to do ,with death i remember this spot as a sacred,burial ground the spears were grim reminders of ,departed warriors velda danced parentally till,suddenly as if from nowhere the death's head ,appeared in her hands i recall pastor's words,that it symbolized imminent death i felt ,cold and clammy wondering who it would be,so,so,the safari took us deeper and deeper ,to a gorilla country but jack and velda,was a sort of outing a lock to me it was a ,search for an answer to an ageless question,could evolution have any basis could it influence ,the mating instinct of a girl whose life had been,half gorilla and half civilized and yet ,i found myself in the defense of favela,where did she come from how long ,have you been with the gorilla pack,i try to remember the details of a missionary ,couple who had been killed in a safari in this,back country about 10 or 12 years before they ,have a daughter was never found afterwards,could it be she was that girl perhaps she was it ,was a long shot whatever the answer it might place,the lives of four people in jeopardy a strange ,quiet came over the safari that is until we came,into a clearing on the banks of the sabi river by ,now cyril was dehydrated but he wouldn't venture,near the water's edge instead he decided to drink ,from a small stream which emptied into the river,cyril drank hotel your water and we drank in ,the scenery as velda identified the various,animals for us she told us of the velda beast an ,animal much like the buffalo back in the states,we watched the ugly laughing hyenas that saw any ,prey left behind by other well-killed denisons,of the forest she pointed out the kudu which ,to me resembled our mule deer the ponderous,elephants are always fun to look at as is the ,impala which is the favorite food of the lion,the zebras as usual were frisky and laughable to ,look at it seems nature made convicts of them for,the moment i forgot my so-called psychological ,study of jungle versus civilization and stood,spellbound by the rugged beauty and serenity of ,the strange country strange people strange animals,to me this was the eternal fascination of africa,but dark continent never failed to ,live up to the expectations i had,the hippos seemed docile and gentle enough as they ,soaked up water and sun yet this provide their,deadly qualities when encountered on the hoof ,they were dangerous and always ready to attack,regardless of the interesting things always ,present we had to continue on our journey at last,i was not exactly impatient but there was ,a problem in my mind waiting to be solved,say doc one question yeah we're not going beyond ,the deeper villages are we i haven't made up my,mind yet we might we're surely not in the gorilla ,country you know this safari could be a lot of fun,if i could only forget that old maharaja's curse ,say you suppose it was anything to what he said,you know people in this part of the world have ,done a puzzle of you and me for thousands of years,back home in the states we dismiss them ,superstitions we wouldn't believe it,no matter how it was presented but out here ,there's some things that seem perfectly natural,my eyes have seen things that my mind refuses ,to accept yet i've seen them well you can,tell me this is none of my business but seldom ,jack seemed perfectly natural and quite happy,it looks as if you've rescued a drowning person ,and now you're throwing her back into the water,well just got a chance to learn how to ,swim maybe i wanted to see if she could,in fact i've gotta know she's been ,sort of a guinea pig hasn't she,charted all her actions and reactions as she ,became civilized do you know it seems to me what,seems to you cyril that we're in the midst of so ,much beauty that we shouldn't waste a minute of it,safari going all right pretty good i guess how's ,velda taking it she's not disappointing me and you,oh look i'm sorry jack i don't mean ,to pry into your private business,i got nothing against velda it's just that ,there's a suspicion up here that i can't put down,i could be wrong you sure ,could i intend to prove it,although things were going consistently well,there was always the possibility of ,danger lurking in the very next brush,i'll take this one off it's all yours,eagle eagle,let's go,later on in the trek we came upon an incident that ,was undoubtedly an ordinary occurrence for velvet,we stood horrified spellbound here was the ,raw grim savagery of the jungle unfolding,before our eyes the law of survival ,of the fittest and it was shocking,cyril was watching with a sick expression jack ,winston but he seemed incapable of doing anything,they were all frozen and revulsive alexa velda ,they caught the look on her face it was fixed and,stalled almost a smirk she was watching something ,which to her was an old story linus must eat,we came out of the brush country ,and saw the ruins of the zimbabwe,directly ahead the yamahosa is a tribe that was ,neither hostile in a civilized inhabited the ruins,but the gun away jack wouldn't do any good ,if those who bullies want to start trouble,why don't we leave before they see us i'm afraid ,they already have those dancers they puzzle me,it was a curious mixture of cannibal ,and modern touches in that dress,yet they were known for their ,ferocity toward other tribes,we were reluctant to go closer ,particularly with veldo long,besides it seemed they were having a big meeting ,of some kind with other natives i had heard that,a renegade white a notorious nairobi smith lived ,among them as their leader seemed strange that a,white man would forsake his own to live among the ,natives so i wondered if he was behind the marmars,do you think those natives would object to ,having their pictures taken i don't think so,they're used to the white men and just be sure ,you tell them how you want to be cooked cyril,pot foil fricaseed or well stewed well i'm ,second thought i think i should save my film,go ahead cyril he's kidding you he is why you ,young tick squeak you're not daughty my courage,pretty good stuff though say dog ,maybe i only get one or two shots,come on cyril i'll go with you you will you will,i was amazed that jack would leave velda ,with me he was by her side so constantly,but at the moment i was more concerned with ,these mixed dances and wondered if possibly,nairobi smith had anything to do with this ,gathering could be he was trying to stir them up,there was a rumor that narobi hated his own people,get a couple of shots for the armor,oh,loops,them bookers gorilla hunters,why do they dance not ordinary dance,gorilla dance bad why is it bad every ,year gorilla come for sacrifice for girls,i'm going to see the chief,present for you,um,hello,let's get out of here,hello,what's the matter that cyril run out of film,i think you better go arthur one of the natives ,got a glimpse of velda and they say i'm sorry,honey they recognized us being part of the ,gorilla pack and they said unless we left,they'd take our prisoners and then lolly walk ,would leave them alone who's lolly what villain,him leader of gorilla my pet hunter shoot him when ,he found me what do we do i guess we'd better go,okay come on,foreign,foreign,i had a premonition of trouble as we left the ,village i thought i could read between the,lines of jack's explanation but somehow i felt ,it had a connection with nairobi smith i don't,like it i got a funny feeling when i've wandered ,around here what do we do arthur let's get moving,oh,we're being followed we better ,find us a spot before our ambush,let's go,foreign,let let go,okay narobi you're all washed up i'm ,taking you into the nearest constabulary,in evil,that's the sally village the last one ,we passed before we hit gorilla country,are the natives friendly very friendly me and the ,chief are good friends i spent a couple of months,here once delivered a whole batch of babies ,uh bella do you know them i don't know them,you'd better stay here with jack why can't ,we take her along with us well it might,prevent some excitement i don't mean it hurt ,or anything it's just that they might get upset,okay i'll stay no jack go velda wait here ,not afraid jack go okay cyril let's go,get the imo out for me,we received a friendly welcome from the ,village there was much here of interest,and cyril had his typical ,reaction he was a real camera bug,i watched jack slyly i thought he might be ,disturbed mentally if he was he showed no,signs we were fascinated by the color of ,the various natives each symbol of a stage,in their lives the paint long skirt and blouses ,represented their marriageable status and the,peculiar designs of the war-like paint on their ,faces told a message to all the eligible males,a stranger in that midst could tell in ,sight whether he confronted a married woman,a betrothed a one who was in search of a mate ,the naked torso painted with red bola or clay,meant that she is engaged in betrayal primitive ,as it seemed it was practical and well conceived,much like our american indian the native women ,carried their bohara or babies on their backs,i thought of jack but not that he was watching ,cyril whose manner of fun was contagious enough,to take jack's mind off felder at least for ,the time being this bevy of girls was in,the custody of the village witch doctor but ,that made no difference to cyril he killed,it with them and the witch doctor took it ,good naturally everybody laughed heartily,i recognize these two as bon ,banas of a neighboring tribe,they were the tallest in africa almost seven feet,that's the chief over there ,i'll be right back fellas,i had a lengthy talk with my friend the ,old chief he told me the gorillas have,gotten worse each year since velda was ,taken from him they were meaner wilder,they hadn't attacked the usally however this was ,probably because of you sally were fighting men,always training for the possibility of battle the ,chief invited us to watch some of his warriors,foreign,cyril was having more fun than the natives ,and kitted with them apparently they shared,his enthusiasm for they giggled and laughed ,at his antics suddenly they started to beat,a rhythm by clapping their hands the chief told ,me this meant the war games were about to start,the wild rhythm was contagious ,and cyril fell into the sway of it,as he convulsed a few of the natives ,with his version of the ball in the jack,laughs,oh,oh,university,the time had come to leave so i had ,the old chief farewell he invited,me back to the village but i had a sneaking ,suspicion he had another baby crop about doom,let's call it a day boys and get moving,come on we didn't realize how long we'd stayed ,in the village until we left had a peculiar,premonition as we needed the spot where gold ,awaited a rather waited because she was gone,something's happened to velda she's gone i ,expected that i only wonder it didn't happen,before now what are you talking about ah forget it ,what do we do now well i'm for getting out of here,what do you say son let's ,go home while we're ahead,well go on home as far as i'm concerned the two ,of you can go straight too i'm gonna find velda,valder why don't you tell him doc he's got a right ,to know i've got a right to know what listen kid,brother i never told you everything this pastor's ,doctor he revealed things to me that i felt,obligated to keep from you but now i'm gonna give ,it to you both barrels whether you like it or not,why don't you wake up wake up to what wake up from ,a nightmare there are things happening around here,that the outside world never heard of but the fact ,remains they're here and we're here these natives,have been sacrificing women their gorillas for ,ages what's that got to do with felder what do,you suppose she came from she might not have ,been a sacrifice maiden but she lived like one,do you expect me to buy that i don't care whether ,you buy it or not i bought it on the lips of a,dying man harster they're all well to live with ,them two and a half years what did you expect,he educated it she revealed every little intimate ,detail do i have to go on go on he learned from,velda that the natives have been sacrificing ,virgins to guerrillas and what's more shocking,these maidens consider it an honor if one does ,escape the natives avoider like the plague and,yet no one of them has ever been found dead are ,you insinuating bella spent most of her life with,the gorilla pack i think she's gone home return to ,her animal instinct boy you better give yourself,a pill she's all woman i oughta know why don't ,you wise up jack she's not a woman she's a beast,i ought to break you into but you're out of ,your head thanks you're not gonna let him,go out there alone are you gonna let him get ,himself killed but i brought him here let's go,so,lolliwog no remember velda,belda come to tell lollywog velda go away,come uh,so,oh,i don't like it it's too quiet,just a chimp but that isn't,don't move he's bluffing shall ,we follow him oh wait a minute,what do we do now go on ahead find a clearing ,make a camp until it gets a little dark,he must have fell asleep what time is ,it it's about 10 o'clock the moon's,up but it ought to be good and dark ,by midnight and we can take off then,where's cyril taking the first watch ,i'm gonna relieve him about 15 minutes,thriller,oh he didn't have a chance,(Dramatic Music),(Dramatic Music),that's felder come on,(Dramatic Music),(Dramatic Music),(cawing),i don't get it some sort of a ritual,(Dramatic Music),okay i've seen it but i still ,don't think beld is any part,(drumming music),see how he's doing bella,listen jack this ape's afraid of a gun,as soon as one of them makes a lunge ,you and bella make a break for it,(Dramatic Music),ahh!,now these are the laws of the jungle ,and many and mighty are they for the,one

nation,and its moral progress,can be measured,by the way it treats,its animals.,Here in York County,it might also be measured,by the justice it seeks,for Avery Alan Ludlow,and his dog Red.,This is Carrie Donnel,reporting for KPZS...,So what do you think?,Well, I don't know,if it'll do any good,,but what you said,,you certainly said it well.,And that means a lot to me.,( man coughs ),( Carrie

prosecute.,After last night?,Well, there are no prints,on the rock or the note.,Anybody could have,done it.,- Nobody else had reason to.,- You know that and I know that.,The court's,a different story.,But that note implied a threat.,Maybe that'll help, Sam.,Not necessarily.,But what it could mean,is that Carrie had better,call into work ASAP.,Right.,( dialing ),So that's it?,No, we could still sue--,hire our own forensics man,,subpoena the shotgun.,Maybe they'd even settle.,But that's just money.,Yeah, just money.,So, uh, you want to,go ahead with this?,Of course I do!,You know I can't do this,for free, Ave.,But I'll try to keep,the cost down.,Thanks, Sam.,I appreciate it.,Oh come on, Barry.,We can't just lay down and let--,Yeah, but we're the only,division that has the freedom,to go after stories like this.,If we give into them now we're just--,( sighs ),Yes, yes.,No no, I understand.,Yeah.,Okay.,That was my editor.,Wants me to cover an apartment,building fire

sorry, Ave.,Okay.,Oh boy.,When I drink,I get so hungry.,You know what I could use?,I could use a piece of that,cherry pie right about now.,and speaking,of sweet things,,You know, I think that,waitress

you, Ave?,What do you want,out of this life?,There must be something.,The truth?,The truth about what?,When I lost Mary...,all I had left of her was,a house, our store,and Red.,Those boys nearly took,all that away from me,and I...,I just need to make,some sense of it.,What if you can't find the,answers that you're looking for?,What if there's no answer?,How do you know when,to stop trying?,I learned one thing,during the war:,That you fight with,whatever you've got,,Whatever you can,lay your hands on...,and you never stop.,The minute you do,,that's the minute the world,rolls right over you.,This is Mary?,She was 53 there.,She was beautiful.,She never thought so.,Carrie:,Well, she was wrong.,She looked so young,for her age.,How old are you, Ave?,I ever ask you that?,- No.,- Well, then.,How come you don't have,any pictures of your sons?,I don't have any sons.,Yes you do,,Sam told me.,He shouldn't have.,We had Timmy late.,I was 48,,Mary was 42.,So it was a kind of surprise,to both of us.,We had to fix up the attic in,order to give him a bedroom.,He was a good boy.,An easy boy.,Favored Mary that way.,But the older boy, Billy,,had been different,right from the start.,He always had a way of turning,a good thing sour on himself.,He always had,a problem with lying,,here at home,and to other people.,He dropped out of school when,they kept him back Junior year.,Went to work for Clover's,Hardware here in town.,Got to work late,half the time.,Stayed out nights,,made up lies about why.,He always had,this way with him,,Like he couldn't,help himself.,I got this idea in my head,that he might work it out,for himself in the service.,Get some discipline in his life.,It had worked for me.,Maybe he wanted to leave,the house by then anyway,,because it was one of the few,times he listened to me,and did what I told him to.,He joined the Navy.,Nine months later,he was out,on a section 8.,- Do you know what that is?,- Mentally unstable.,Unfit is the word,they use.,The night it happened...,I was with Emma,down at the store,taking the six-month,inventory.,It was the dead of winter.,Tim was asleep,in the bedroom upstairs,,Mary was reading,in the kitchen.,It was about 11:30,by the time,we finished the inventory.,When he told,the story later,to the police,,to the detectives,,to the lawyers,,Billy lied.,But it was confused lying.,It was as if he couldn't actually,remember what had happened.,He'd lie about one thing,and then tell the truth about,whatever the hell that was,and then go back and lie,about the first thing again.,Or something,completely different.,It just went on that way.,But how we pieced it,together was...,Billy had come around the house,earlier that evening,looking for some money.,Mary told him no.,Told him if he wanted money,he'd have to come down to,the store and talk to me.,Well, he knew he wasn't,going to do that.,I'd had it by then.,So they argued,and eventually he left.,Then just before 11:00,He came back to the house,again still looking for money.,And Mary still told,him no again.,I don't know why,,but he...,locked Red here,,up here in the bedroom.,Maybe he was barking,,I don't know.,Then he went back out,to the kitchen,and started hitting her.,Beating her.,Maybe he thought he'd get,money from her that way.,Maybe it was just one,of his crazy rages.,But he hurt her.,He hurt her so bad,I guess he thought,he'd killed her.,Because then he decided--,he decided he'd have to,cover up what he did.,So he went out,to the tool shed,and got the can of kerosene,I used to keep out there...,went up to the attic bedroom,and threw it all over Tim.,All over my son,who was lying asleep.,He burned him to death...,up there in his room.,But kerosene doesn't burn,as hot as gasoline.,I mean,,he killed Tim all right,,the boy was saturated,with the stuff.,But all that burned,up there was my son,and the mattress he lay on.,Not even the drapes,caught fire.,He...,closed the bedroom door,,locked it behind him,,stood outside and waited,till my son,stopped screaming.,Until it was quiet.,Then he came back down,and threw the kerosene over Mary,lying on the kitchen floor, lit,another match and threw that on her.,Then got into his car,and drove away.,But she...,my wife,wasn't dead.,Oh, he'd hurt her,,but he hadn't killed her.,She was still alive.,He'd got it wrong.,Wrong about that just like,he was wrong,about the kerosene,burning the house down.,He was wrong about,everything always.,It was all for nothing.,I guess the pain woke her.,She managed to get,herself outside,And roll across the ground,on the dirt and the grass,until the flames were out.,Then she still had,enough left in her,to crawl back into the house,and dial 911.,They found her on the stairs,halfway up to Tim's bedroom.,She lived,for another five days.,Never did come out,of the coma.,I think that was,a blessing.,Her burns were so bad,they wouldn't let me,hold her.,In the end,I did anyway.,( dog barking ),Thank you.,( car starts ),- Danny: Pete!,- Pete: I'm leaving right now.,I don't care.,- No!,- Leave a little bit!,Pete:,I didn't fucking take it!,Don't you lie.,Go back in the house,,you crazy

either,your time or your money.,I'm wondering if you're proud,of Daniel, Mr. McCormack.,Because if not,,then there's gonna be trouble,between you and the boy.,And that's something you may,care to do something about,while you still have time,,instead of using your money,to cover up for him.,You know, I don't need,any lectures from you.,My boys are my boys.,And I'll handle them any way,I see fit, okay?,If you're gonna sue me,,just go ahead and do it.,It'll cause me,some embarrassment,in some places,,but it won't,hurt me very--,very much.,So do it.,And if you could win, what,are you gonna get

the police left,,Toni had lots of drinks,,and she and baker had a row.,She told him he wasn't as,good a man as Dave Robinson.,What?,And then he went as white as a sheet,and slapped her face and,she ran out of the place.,But the look he gave her,was, it was frightening.,You know things,are beginning to add up.,He slapped her face,when she mentioned Dave.,That means there must be some,tie between Dave and baker.,Look honey when you go there tomorrow,,keep your ears and eyes open,,find out everything you can.,Okay Ted.,But you don't go getting,mixed up in it will you.,Me?,I'm just gonna sit at home,and read all about it in the papers.,Come in.,Yes?,Is Mr. Baker in with Mr. Gregory?,I brought my photo,for outside the palais.,They're not to be disturbed.,Will you leave it with me.,Thanks,

on this very spot,Ron Nasty and Dirk McQuickly,first bumped into each other,At this precise point,,just a few feet back here,Ron Nasty invited Dirk,to help him stand up,Dirk, merely an amateur drinker, agreed.,And here, well a few feet back there,a musical legend was created.,They were soon joined by their guitarist,,Stig O'Hara, a school-leaver of no fixed,hairstyle,But it would not be for another two years,,before they found their drummer,,Barrington Womble, hiding in the van,When they did they persuaded him to,change his name, to save time,,and his haircut, to save Brylcreem,He became

Goose-step Mama,In October 1961 Leggy Mountbatten,,a retail chemist from Bolton,,entered their lives,Leggy had lost a leg in the RAF,in the closing over?s of WW2,and had been hopping around,Liverpool ever since,As a child, Leggy's mother never allowed,him to play with the other little boys,His father was so snobby,,he wore swimming trunks in the bath,to stop him looking down on,the unemployed,But it was here, in Liverpool th...,But it was in Liverpool, that we spoke with,Leggy's mother Mrs. Iris Mountbatten,Well he told me that he'd been to see,these young men in a dark cellar,Yes,He was always very interested,in young men,Oh, yes,Youth clubs,,Boy Scouts, that sort of thing,Yes,But...these he said were different,In what way?,Well...their hair and...,their presence,and their music,He liked it?,No, he hated it,Well what did he like?,Well,The trousers,What about their trousers?,Well...they were,They were very...tight,Tight?,- Yes, you could see quite clearly,- Oh I see,Everything,Outlines...clear as day,Yes, yes thank you yes,So...tight trousers and,- Nothing left to the imagination,- Yes, thank you,I am standing in the world's,naughtiest street, the notorious,Reeperbahn, Hamburg,For four hungry working class lads,There are worse places than prison,And the Rat Keller, Hamburg,is one of these,This is where they found themselves,Far from home and far from talented,Inside here is where they actually played,Come with me now inside, or...,As the Germans say,,""mit mirer gekommen inside"",In those early days,,there was a fifth Rutle - Leppo,A friend of Nasty?s,from art college,Who mainly used to stand at the back,,he couldn't play the guitar,But he knew how to have a good time,,and in Hamburg that was more important,I am standing in the original Rat Keller,,and indeed these are some,of the original rats,It was to this small back room that,Dirk, Stig, Nasty, Barry and Leppo,came to relax when they weren't,upstairs entertaining the other rats,dining in the other Rat Keller,Here they had bed & breakfast. there's the bed,,the breakfast of course long since gone,Rodently chewed, mouse masticated,,in a word, eaten by rats,Incidentally, Rat Keller means literally,,in German, cellar of rats,That's not seller of rats, a seller of rats,,a person,Who sells rats for a living to another man,as it were, of course not,It means a cellar full of rats,Indeed you might say,,cellar full of Ratles,In October 19...ah...err...Hello!,Oh dear, there's a rat up my leg,In October 1961 Leggy was busy hopping round,London, trying to sell their tapes,Well, one day this rather odd chap,hopped into the office...he'd...,He'd been to see virtually every-one in the business,,and been shown the door,He asked to see my door,,but I...I wouldn't show it to him,Instead he showed me the photographs,,and the tapes of The Rutles,They were pretty rough...,but they had something,What was it?,I think it was the trousers,Well I liked the trousers right away,Well I mean I've been in the garment trade myself and,I knew a thing or two about inside legs and,these were winners,Dick Jaws, an unemployed music publisher,of no fixed ability,signed them up for the rest of their lives,Lucky really,# Number One, Number One,# You're my Number One,# You're my second-to-none,# Number One, Number One,Leggy Mountbatten in his autobiography,""A Cellar Full Of Goys"",of the excitement of those early days,When they rode the go-kart to fame,and took the ferry across the Mersey to a land,of riches, wealth and heartache,Leggy put them into suits,,he put them into the recording studio,and he put them into the newspapers,For The Rutles,success was only a drumbeat away,# I'm looking at you,# You're looking at me,# Between us, it's oh, so easy to see,# We were made for each other, girl,# We were made for each other,# Between us,# Love has begun,# Between us,# Two hearts are one,# Between us,# Nothing can come between us,# Whatever we do,# Whenever we kiss,# Between you and me,,it's not hit n' miss ,# We were made for each other, girl,# We were made for each other,# Between us,# Love has begun,# Between us,They chased me,,and they caught me,,and they beat me up,Who did?,Those little girls,One of them screamed in my ear,# Between us,# Nothing can come,# Nothing can come between us,I asked Mick Jagger,,when he first became aware of,The Rutles,We we living in, you know,,squalor and we didn't have any money,And there were the Rutles on the TV,with girls chasing them, we thought...,""This can't be that difficult"",,so we thought we'd have a go ourselves,What's your ambition?,To be a hairdresser,Or Two.,I'd like to be two hairdressers,The first time I met The Rutles,,they came down to see us at Richmond and they...,And we had just completed,a number and all of a sudden they,were standing there,In their black suits,,they had just come off a TV show,And they were just standing there...,sort of...checking us out, the opposition,And then they introduced themselves,Dirk, Stig, Nasty, Barry.,I'd like to own a squadron of tanks,They were very nice, you know,because they'd heard about us...,Because we were the south's answer to,The Rutles, you know, at that time,What Ron and I will do is probably,to write some songs,,you know, and sell them to people,We tried to write some for the Rolling Stones,and they're probably going to buy them,The one for that was Dirk.,He was a real hustler for the songs I think,Always wanting to sell a song, you know,,for any old slag he'd sell a song to,And they came down, they came down,,and we were trying to rehearse,and they said: ""Do you want a song?"",And we said: ""Yeah we're always really open for songs"",because we didn't write our own,And of course The Rutles were always well known for their,hit-making potential...ability,And so, they ran round the corner to the pub,,to write this song, and came back with it,And played it to us,,and...,it was horrible,So we never bothered to record it,It was a busy week for the prefab four,,as the fever of Rutlemania rolls over England,On Tuesday Rutlemania,came to London,As Rutles fans jammed Piccadilly Circus,and brought London's traffic to a standstill,Nobody's seen anything quite like this,since the war,Look out girls!,Here come The Rutles!,And for some, the event is clearly too

Named after the Cuban guerrilla,leader, Che Stadium,And it was here, in 1965, that The Rutles came,,well, not here in the car park obviously,But back there, in the stadium,that The Rutles came in 1965 to a,capacity house, a sell-out,The thing I remember about it is them,running out into the middle of this field,And you couldn't see them,,there they were, like, you know,,just miles away,There...is it really The Rutles?,It might be somebody else,# There was no one in my life till I met you,# You brought me love and taught me how to smile,# You picked me up when I was feeling blue,# From now on my future is worthwhile,# It's lookin' good, it's lookin' good,# It's lookin' good, it's lookin' good,# It's lookin' good!,# Now that you have given me reason to live,# I will stay forever by your side,# And give you all the lovin' I can give,# Just say the word, and be my bride,# It's lookin' good, it's lookin' good,# It's lookin' good, it's lookin' good,# It's lookin' good!,# I'm not throwing caution to the winds, oh no,# Love is not an easy game to play,# Though I may not be a man of words, yeah, yeah,# There is one thing I feel obliged to say,# It's lookin' good, it's lookin' good,# It's lookin' good, it's lookin' good,# It's lookin' good,You couldn't hear anything,How long did they play?,About twenty minutes and that was it,,off, helicopter,Back to the Warwick Hotel,,two birds each,In 1966 The Rutles faced the,biggest threat to their careers,Nasty, in a widely quoted interview,Apparently had claimed that,The Rutles were bigger than God,And had gone on to say that God,had never had a hit record,The story spread like,wildfire in America,Many fans burnt their albums,Many more burnt their fingers,attempting to burn their albums,Album sales sky-rocketed, people,were buying them, just to burn them,But in fact it was all a ghastly mistake,Nasty talking to a,slightly deaf journalist,Had claimed only that The Rutles,were bigger than Rod,Rod Steward would not be big,for another eight years,That's all I said you know,,now all this has to happen,- What do you think it proves?,- I think it proves you're all daft!,I suppose I'll get into trouble,for saying that now,Nasty apologised to God, Rod and the press,and the tour went ahead as planned,But it would be The Rutles last,Playing all the places where we're supposed to play,,and we hope we can, you know, bring a bit of,You know, je ne sais quoi to America,At the end of it they met Bob Dylan,in the idyllic San Francisco of the mid-sixties,And he introduced them to a strange substance,,which was to have an enormous affect on them,Tea,Despite warnings that it would,lead to stronger things,The Rutles enjoyed the,pleasant effects of tea,And it influenced enormously,their greatest work: Sgt. Rutters,Of course the main thing that comes to my mind,with the Sgt. Rutter album is,Getting stoned and listening to it,with the earphones you know,Particularly the, you know, the chord,that lasted forever you know,The release of this album,,a millstone in pop music history,Contributed greatly to an idyllic summer of,bells, flowers and tea drinking,It's music led thousands to,experiment with tea,Eventually even the press found out,and offered Dirk the chance to deny it,It's not up to me, if you come,and ask me I'm going to tell you the truth,Because it is the truth,,I have had tea,Lots of tea...Indian tea...,...and biscuits,Dirk's admission created a scandal,,the press grabbed hold of the,wrong end of the stick,And started to beat about the bush with it,Many pop-stars were arrested,for using and possessing tea,Nasty himself was busted by,Detective Inspector Brian Plant,Who brought his own,,to be on the safe side,The Rutles meanwhile,appeared live on TV,Before a worldwide audience of two hundred million,with a song that expressed the feeling of the age,Tea was on every-one's lips,# ...In your own time,# Love Life,# To live is to live...,# Where there's a will, there's a way,# Love is the meaning of life,# Life is the meaning of love,# Love

slightly different form,there of choral music, with a slight difference,We'll be back with Prince Charles,in just a moment,""Love Life"" is in many ways,,the high watermark of their careers,For a start Leggy Mountbatten,was rapidly becoming a worry,Always emotionally involved,with them,He had far less to do,once they ceased touring,Of course he had other artistes,The McKismo Brothers,Arthur Hodson and the Kneecaps,As well as the French,Beach Boys: Les Garcons De La Plage,But his decision to put money,into bull-fighters as a tax dodge,Plus his unusual personal life,In California he'd been arrested for giving,the kiss of life to a rubber raft,Gave increasing grounds for concern,I asked Mick Jagger if he was aware,of these tendencies of Leggy's,Oh yeah...Leggy yeah you're kidding,,Leggy got around a bit you know,And that was alright, you know,,until he started going off with the bull-fighters,I think, that...,That era, and then I think they got,a bit disenchanted with him,And he didn't know where to go, you know,,you know, in his life I think,And they wanted to,control more of themselves, you know,Stig meanwhile had fallen under the influence of,Arthur Sultan, the 'Surrey Mystic',And Sultan had introduced Stig,to his Ouija board work,Arthur Sultan now invited The Rutles,on a getaway from it all,Table-tapping weekend,near Bognor.,As usual the,press followed,The Bognor thing was really funny,,the ""Bognor Express"" they called it in the newspapers,Some-one was very late,,one of the girls, they were always late,One of them, I can't remember who it was,,maybe Nasty,Thought we were trying to get on the Rutles bandwagon, you know,,The Rutles mystical bandwagon, which wasn't,true at all,We were just as eager to find out what was going on,in this board-tapping thing at Bognor as anybody,# In this day and age,# Love is all the rage,# Life goes on,,it only goes to show ,# It's not my cup of tea,# It's all the same to me,# For we are here today,and gone tomorrow... ,But while The Rutles sat,at the foot of the Surrey mystic,Fate dealt them an appalling blow,It was here that they learnt,the shocking news of their manager,Leggy Mountbatten, tired and,despondent over the weekend,And unable to raise any friends,,went home and tragically...,Accepted a teaching post,in Australia,It was a kind of funny weekend that,,and then of course at the end of it,We found out that Leggy had gone off to Australia,,which kind of put the mockers on the whole thing really,It was a bombshell for The Rutles.,They were shocked and stunned,- Well we're shocked,- Yes shocked,Shocked,And stunned,Yes stunned,Very stunned,Did Arthur Sultan have any words,of encouragement for you?,- No,- Well yes,Well, yes and no,He said it took allsorts to make a world,And that we shouldn't worry unduly,about were he'd gone,You know he said...we shouldn't get covered with grief,at thoughts of Australia,Because...,He did say we could still keep in touch with him,by tapping

Rutter album,Stig is leaning in the exact position of a dying Yeti,from the 'Rutland Book of the Dead',Five: if you sing the title of,""Sgt. Rutter's Only Darts Club Band"" backwards,it is supposed to sound very like,""Stig has been dead for ages honestly"",In fact it sounds uncannily like,""dnab bulc ylno srettur tnaegres"",Palatable nonsense,Stig was of course, far from dead,,although not in fact, far from Esher,He'd fallen in bed,with Gertrude Strange,A large breasted biologically,accommodating American girl,Who's father had,invented the limpet mine,When they met, it was,lust at first sight,Barry meanwhile had also spent a,year in bed as a tax dodge,Eric Manchester thinks that,he'd either received appalling financial advice,or that he was desperately trying to start,a ""Barry is also dead"" rumour,When he finally got up,Rutle Corps was in a perilous financial plight,Nasty had flown back in a hurry,from his honeymoon rally in Nuremburg,To meet the most feared,promoter in the world,Ron Decline,Decline had a reputation,as a hard man,His only weak spot,was dishonesty,Any-one was free to inspect his books,,but no-one could find his accounts,He struck terror into,the hearts of his subordinates,People would commit suicide,rather than meet him,In business his left hand never knew,who his right hand was doing,Nasty adored him,,he was a man after his own wallet,Decline promised The Rutles that if they let him,take care of their royalties,They would never have,to worry about money again,Stig meanwhile was accepting the,financial advice of Billy Kodak,Whilst Dirk had invited Arnold,Schwarzenweisengreenenbluenbraunenburger,To handle his end of the name,,Barry was consulting the I Ching every,three and a half minutes,There was a plethora of lawyers,Suddenly every-one became,amazingly,I remember, I'd get up in the morning, sue some-one,,check in the papers I hadn't been fired,Go to the office, sue some-one,,pick up the morning's writ, sue the bank,Go out to lunch,,sue the restaurant,Get back in, collect the writs that,had been received that afternoon,Read the papers, phone the papers,,sue the papers, and go home,To the wife,They're asking me ""Where's the money, where's the money?"",I mean I don't know where the money is,I've never been good with figures,,you know that,I don't know anything about math,,it was never my good subject,I don't know where the money is, but if you,need money, I'll give you money,But this...,this, really, surprises me...,I'm really shocked,Because I thought we had,something here a lot stronger than just business,I mean you know, I love you,more than I love my own family, I do,I wanna protect you, I wanna help you,I wanna protect you,from the outside world,Protect you...protect you from...,...people like me,At the final meeting a hundred and,thirty four legal people and accountants,Filed into a small,eight by ten room,Only eighty seven came out alive,The black hole of Savile Row,Had taken toll of some of the finest,merchant banking brains of a generation,Luckily that's not very serious,But The Rutles were obviously,self-destructing fast,In the midst of all,this public bickering,'Let It Rot' was released as a,film, a album and a lawsuit,In 1970 Dirk sued,Stig, Nasty and Barry,Barry sued,Dirk, Nasty and Stig,Nasty sued Barry,,Dirk and Stig,And Stig sued,himself accidentally,It was the beginning of,a golden era for lawyers,But for The Rutles, live,on a London rooftop,It was the beginning of the end,#

        [SOMBER CLASSICAL MUSIC],MARTIN SHEEN: Thousands of Poles,walk with determination,under a hot August sun.,Their destination, Saint,Stanislaus Kostka Church.,Blocking every street and alley,are,the tanks, water cannon, and,lead filled batons,of the militia.,They have been ordered to stop,these people,with force, if necessary.,They have come to here a,35-year-old priest named,Father Jerzy Popieluszko, a,chaplain for the trade union,
,
,
,
,solidarity, a linchpin of the,opposition underground,and a peaceful voice of truth,and justice for his people.,JERZY POPIELUSZKO:,JERZY POPIELUSZKO:,MARTIN SHEEN: In three years,,this extraordinary priest,mobilized a nation to make their,dreams of freedom a reality.,His monthly masses, celebrations,of dignity and peace,,spoke of the injustice and,tyranny,of the communist system.,There we were free, safe, and,not afraid of anything.,PRIEST: The government, they,knew they were not able to stop,people from coming to the mass.,At this point, it wasn't,impossible.,MARTIN SHEEN: To the communist,regime that has ruled Eastern,
,
,
,
,Europe with an iron fist since,the end of World War II,and to the secret police hiding,among the crowd,,he is the most dangerous man in,Poland.,PRIEST: All the way from Moscow,,through Warsaw, to east,Bahrain, the entire communist,system,was afraid of Father Jerzy,Popieluszko.,And his only weapon was the,truth.,[CROWD CHEERING],MARTIN SHEEN: On November 9th,,1989,,east and west Germans gathered,at the Berlin Wall,with sledgehammers and pickaxes,and began tearing it down.,These iconic images, broadcast,worldwide,,proclaim the reunification of,Germany,and signaled the end of,communism.,But the end of communism in,Poland,began years earlier in an,otherwise unremarkable,church in Warsaw with the words,of Father Jerzy Popieluszko.,JERZY POPIELUSZKO: [SPEAKING,POLISH],[CLASSICAL MUSIC],MARTIN SHEEN: At the Yalta,Conference in 1945,,Prime Minister Churchill and,President Roosevelt,handed Poland over to General,Secretary Joseph Stalin,believing his promise to operate,Poland,on a broader democratic basis.,JOHN MOODY: Poland has always,been a pawn of the world,,whether it's Russia or Western,Europe, United States.,It's always been a tradable,entity.,Here Stalin, we'll give you,Poland,and you give us two players to,be named later.,MARTIN SHEEN: Under Stalin the,communist controlled,everything in Eastern Europe.,The media was run by the state.,Wages and food prices were,manipulated,and dissension was quickly and,brutally,crushed by the secret police.,GRAZYNA SIKORSKI: It is actually,the essence,of the communist regime because,it wants,to control all aspects of,person's life,,including your thoughts, your,ideas.,And if you think about it, you,rely on the state,for everything in your life.,MARTIN SHEEN: But from the,start, Poland resisted.,With its population of 38,million people, 95% Catholic,,the church and its leadership,were,uniquely responsible for the,preservation,of Poland's national identity.,The head of the Catholic Church,in Poland,was the primate, Cardinal Stefan,Wyszynski.,He was beloved by the people, a,constant thorn in the side,of the communist establishment,,and a wily tactician who,was able to maintain and grow,the church's influence,for more than three decades.,CARDINAL JOZEF GLEMP:,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: Cardinal Wyszynski,knew communism very well.,He was probably one of the only,Polish people,with Marx's book read cover to,cover.,MARTIN SHEEN: For 40 years, the,communist regime,used all available firepower to,enforce their will.,Nuns and priests were routinely,tried and executed.,And the Polish people were,ground into submission.,Then in 1979, everything,changed.,[CROWD CHEERING],It's June 2 and Victory Square,in Warsaw, Poland is full.,A million people have come to,see,Poland's newest hero, Cardinal,Karol,Wojtyla, now Pope John Paul II.,Somewhere in this massive crowd,is a 32-year-old priest,named Father Jerzy Popieluszko.,[APPLAUSE],KRZYSZTOF MEISSNER: And I,remember standing there.,And I remember these words, let,the spirit come,and renew the face of this,earth.,Absolutely clear message.,I am there.,I will support you.,But you have to do it yourself.,That was a clear message.,And I remember the effect that,it had on the crowd.,That was like a thunderbolt.,[APPLAUSE],[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: The church,hierarchy,,such as primate Wyszynski and,the bishops,,the cardinal Wojtyla never,agreed with Marxism,,with communism.,They preached freedom of man,,freedom, man's,right to freedom.,And that's how one can explain,this connection,between the people, the factory,workers, and intelligentsia,and the church.,JAN ZARYN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: When the Pope came,in June of 1979,,we found out again we were,Poles.,And that made the communist,authorities disappear.,If only for a week, it was the,first week,without communists since 1945.,without communists since 1945.,MARTIN SHEEN: After months of,fruitless negotiations,,17,000 workers at the Lenin,shipyards,in the northern Baltic Port of,Gdansk,went on an occupation strike,,locking the gates,and shutting down the entire,operation.,The strike committee chose a,charismatic former shipyard,electrician as their leader.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],LECH WALESA: [NON-ENGLISH,SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: The communists were,following a simple rule,,do not allow the protesters to,organize.,And we couldn't build solidarity,because we were,being constantly dismantled.,And then, we got help from,heaven.,A poll was chosen as pope.,Without the pope we wouldn't be,able to organize,ourselves for a long time.,We wouldn't be able to fight,communism.,JERZY BOROWCZAK: [NON-ENGLISH,SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: We were protesting,so that people,would be treated seriously.,They were getting fired and,thrown out of work.,And that's what the strikes were,for, to say, no, enough.,You can't fire people because,they go to church,and believe in a free Poland.,[CONGREGATION SINGING],MARTIN SHEEN: Young priests,,like Father Popieluszko,,took the Pope's words as a,personal challenge.,He used the words of the Holy,Father,in his new position as the,chaplain,to nursing and medical students,,helping,them to form strike committees,based on the principles,of nonviolence.,During the 1980s, Roger Boyes,was stationed,in Warsaw for the Times.,He reported on the birth of the,first free trade union,in the Soviet bloc called,Solidarity and its leader,Lech Walesa.,ROGER BOYES: And this,combination of legitimate,worker grievances, a theology of,freedom and a champion in Rome,that changed the chemistry that,in previous post-war uprisings,,in 1956, in 1968, 1970--,The role of Catholicism wasn't,really that important.,We didn't have a Polish Pope.,It had changed, something,fundamental had changed.,MARTIN SHEEN: 10,000 employees,of the massive steel mill,in Warsaw shut down the,machinery,and locked themselves inside the,gates.,The first Sunday of the strike,,three workers,snuck out of the mill and went,to see,Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski with,an unusual request.,They asked for a priest to enter,the striking mill and say mass.,The cardinal saw an opportunity,here,he had been waiting for, the,gospel,heard inside the hallowed walls,of communist power,,the steel mill.,He also knew the perfect man for,the task.,A priest who was surprisingly,courageous,,who had a deep faith and hope,for his people and his country.,And yet he was only 33 years,old.,Alfonso Alec Popieluszko was,born,September 14th, 1947 in the,small farming,community of Okopy.,When he was old enough, Alec,would walk two miles,every morning to serve as an,altar boy,at Saint Peter's and Paul,Church.,At age 17, Alec left the small,town life behind and traveled,on his own to Warsaw to present,himself,before the rector of Saint John,the Baptist Seminary.,In 1965 he was accepted.,And although he was not the,brightest student,,he impressed everyone with his,friendliness and passion,for his calling.,In 1966, Father Jerzy was a year,into his seminary studies,when he was sent with his fellow,classmates,to a communist military base for,their compulsory two,years in the Army.,The seminarians were placed in a,unit separate and unique,from the rest of the cadets,,part,of a carefully planned system of,atheistic indoctrination.,Bible study and prayer were,strictly forbidden.,But unlike some of his brothers,,Father Jerzy did pray.,He said the rosary in the open,and he refused,to take off his scapular.,FATHER MARLON JANEUS:,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: That's what,Popieluszko,was like when he was ordered to,put away his prayer,book, to stop praying, or to put,away,his rosary or holy pendant.,I think most seminarians might,have followed orders,,but he protested out loud and,with a clear message.,MARTIN SHEEN: He was ordered to,stand at attention.,Sometimes all night long.,Sometimes in the rain and snow,and often barefoot.,TRANSLATOR: And this was the,reason,why, using the military jargon,,they put the screws to him.,It was like that until he left.,MARTIN SHEEN: Father Jerzy's,time in the military damaged,his health beyond repair.,But despite spending his last,year of seminary,in and out of the hospital.,He was ordained on May 28th,,1972.,Father Jerzy embraced the,assignment,from Cardinal Wyszynski.,And on August 31st, 1980, he,walked past a gauntlet,of armed riot police, through,the gates,of the Warsaw steel mill, and,into the hearts,of its striking workers.,The gate opens and he's,literally sucked into this,,the steel mill crowd.,The guys bring him inside and,then they start to applaud.,And he looks around thinking to,himself,,who are they applauding for?,I'm just a priest.,I'm just here to say mass.,TRANSLATOR: A priest had never,ever,entered the steel mill grounds.,This was unimaginable.,Once I tried to organize a,Catholic group here,for the young workers, but I was,ridiculed.,This was a communist fortress,that,only served the communists.,That is how the totalitarian,regime saw it.,ROGER BOYES: It was clear that,something,was happening in the capital.,And it was clear that the regime,was really,worried about the transfusion of,the Gdansk spirit into Warsaw.,I mean it was already happening,,but nevertheless Huta Warszawa,was the kind of communist,fortress,that had been penetrated by the,Church.,And Popieluszko had done the,penetrating.,JERZY POPIELUSZKO:,MARTIN SHEEN: On that same day,in Gdansk,,Lech Walesca signed an agreement,legalizing the first free trade,union in a communist country.,It was called Solidarity.,For months, nothing had left the,factories of Poland.,With pressure from Russia to get,them back,to work and unwilling or unable,to resort to violence,,the communist government caved,to the striker's demands.,In front of the World Press, the,Solidarity Agreement,removed the Communist Party's,control,over the industrial enterprise,,increased the minimum wage,,and abolished censorship,throughout the country.,ROGER BOYES: The main thing was,to keep,the communist monopoly over the,working class basically.,The whole point of the Communist,Party,was it was the voice of the,working class.,If you let anyone compete, voice,workers problems,,you were in trouble.,So the idea was pretend a bit,,let them feel that they were,getting something, give them a,few concessions, which,maybe were justifiable anyway.,And then later you scratch it,all back.,Was this going to be the first,crack in the Iron Curtain?,It could have been. We didn't,know it.,Turns out, yes, it absolutely,was.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: Poland was trying to,break free.,And 1980 was such an attempt.,It was successful in the sense,that 10 million,people joined Solidarity.,But if you think about it,,families, wives, children,,you need to multiply that by two,or three.,This no longer means 10 million,members, but 20 or 30 million.,So pretty much all the Poles,,the whole nation.,ROGER BOYES: Suddenly newspapers,could write what they want.,The censorship disappeared.,And that was amazing.,You would see people queuing for,newspapers, probably the one,time in history that people,actually,stood regularly every day, not,just,for bread, but for newspapers.,PAUL HENSLER: There were a lot,more liberties,around the steel mill.,He started visiting their,families.,He started baptizing their,children.,He started tending to the sick,of the steel workers.,But the people loved it.,They loved the way he spoke to,them, the workers,,about their problems, not about,the church's problems.,He spoke about their homes,,their families,,their work, their money, their,lack of money.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: It was such euphoria,for us.,And it was new, but so obvious,to us,that these unions will be,formed,,at least after the Solidarity,registration.,And it was a big celebration for,us.,And we realized we created a new,page in our Polish history.,And nothing would ever change,it.,And nobody could take it away,,absolutely none.,ROGER BOYES: Yeah, it was,freedom.,But of course also a time of,chronic shortages,and sort of slightly quiet,desperation as well.,Sometimes when people write or,describe this period,it sounds like it was massive,carnival.,And it was in a way.,TRANSLATOR: Our relationship,grew.,Father Popieluszko invited,Seweryn Jaworski and others,to visit him at Saint Stanislaw,Kostka Parish where,he worked as a resident priest.,We paid him a visit.,And then he would visit us at,the factory.,He wanted to know what we were,doing, what our strike,issues were, and he saw the,formation of the union,and our work for Solidarity.,ROGER BOYES: Popieluszko had,this special magnetism.,And he was making these,linkages.,He was making these linkages,between students,,young workers, older workers,,country, capital.,He was bringing it all together.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: Father Jerzy,organized meetings,with journalists, sociologists,,professors, historians,,and they taught us how to,communicate with authorities,,how to behave with danger.,So that Solidarity members,,unified against the government,,could connect and communicate,effectively.,You can say thanks to Father,Jerzy for this.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: People started,thinking differently,about their work and study,conditions,,which in turn fueled the fight,for democracy.,Maybe some of the requests were,not fully,understood by the workers.,But the fight for a different,reality had begun.,They asked him to design a flag,that,would help them show the,permanence,of the union at the steel mill.,And he was overjoyed.,I mean first being asked to be,their chaplain.,He finally had a family that was,his and he was responsible for.,His pastor said, go for it.,MARTIN SHEEN: What started that,morning as a simple procession,of the steel mill Solidarity,flag to Father Jerzy's church,,morphed into a massive crowd,control nightmare,that the government had not,sanctioned.,20,000 people showed up at this,little church in Warsaw.,And the police had no idea it,was going to happen.,There was no permits.,It completely freaked them out.,They didn't have enough men to,ask for IDs.,The church yard was full.,Even the pastor of the Church,was a little shocked saying,,can you get more of the people,inside the church,so we don't cause a ruckus?,It just didn't work.,MARTIN SHEEN: The door of,freedom had opened a crack.,And now 38 million Poles wanted,to barge through it.,[CLASSICAL MUSIC],MARTIN SHEEN: With the death of,their beloved cardinal,,Stefan Wyszynski, in May of,1981, the new primate,,Cardinal Josef Glemp walked,right in to the growing unease,between Solidarity, the Catholic,Church,,and the Communist Party.,He joined some of the major,Solidarity leaders,in warning the young union that,they should,not ask for too much too soon.,[CROWD CHANTING],To the Kremlin, Solidarity with,ideological suicide.,And there was a danger of it,spreading like a virus,throughout the Soviet bloc.,They hastily dismissed the,civilian government,and installed army general,Wojciech Jaruzelski,,putting the army in control.,That was the first sign that,the regime,was willing to use force, to use,force to preserve communism.,This was the thing.,Because what had happened in all,those months, those kind,of absolute helter-skelter,months,,the Communist Party had become,more and more marginalized,,less and less relevant and was,absolutely in chaos,,absolutely in retreat.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: I declare that,today,,the military council of national,salvation has been formed.,In accordance with the,Constitution,,the state council has imposed,martial law,all over the country.,MARTIN SHEEN: On December 13th,,1981,,Jaruzelski declared war on the,Polish people.,Everything was shut down--,travel, communication, schools,,factories, everything.,Suddenly, just shortly after,midnight the telexes stopped,,mid-sentence.,And then we really knew,something had happened.,If you cut off all communication,with the outside world,,you know something's happening.,MARTIN SHEEN: That night 500,000,soldiers of the Polish People's,Army were mobilized.,They moved in and blockaded,every city.,They raided the homes of,Solidarity leaders,and dragged them from their,beds.,Every Solidarity office,throughout the country,was broken into and ransacked.,By the end of the evening, 5,000,people had,been arrested without cause.,In the end, more than 90 people,were killed,and hundreds more had been,wounded.,In 12 short hours, Jaruzelski's,government erased any trace,that Solidarity ever existed.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: Martial law was a,paralyzing situation.,My younger brother was home on,leave from the army.,And I had to tell him to,immediately go back to his base,so he would not be,court-martialed.,We both were praying not to meet,in the days to come.,So my mother was saying goodbye,to her two sons.,One was going to Zoliborz, to,Father Jerzy,,and the other was going to the,military base.,All of a sudden it is no hope,at all.,And people start to think, where,do you go back, to 1945?,Does it mean that all freedoms,are,going to be taken away from us?,How to continue on with living?,Because the first thing that,happened,,when martial law was declared,,was,that 5,000 people were detained,and put into internment camps.,MARTIN SHEEN: Father Jerzy began,hearing the names,of some of those arrested.,His friends from the steel mill,and Solidarity--,Karol Sidorsky, Jacek Kuron,,Stefan Jaworski,,and Anna Walentynowicz.,Families were left without,paychecks,or food coupons and no idea,where their loved,ones had been taken.,Within 24 hours Father Jerzy had,cleared the basement,of his church, set up a locator,map of jails and prisons,,And sent out volunteers to check,on the families.,In the ensuing days, some union,members,chose to fight back, despite,being outnumbered and unarmed.,TRANSLATOR: These were the first,few weeks of martial law.,We were keeping track of who was,imprisoned, who was jailed,,and who was taken away.,And he said that he would like,to have information on what is,happening during these trials.,Who was convicted in what room,,what day, and in what case.,I said, OK, no problem because I,worked there.,And I moved around easily.,MARTIN SHEEN: With Solidarity,effectively eliminated,,Jaruzelski set his sights on the,Catholic Church.,He appointed hardliners to every,key position in the government.,An important assignment was,General Czeslaw Kiszczak,who was named Minister of,Internal Affairs, the office,that controlled the secret,police and a clandestine unit,called Department 4, whose sole,mandate was to spy,on every church in Poland.,But there were only two that,they were really,,really concerned about in 1980.,One was Saint Bridget's in,Gdansk because of Lech Walesa,and Father Jankowski, his,confessor.,The one that they were even more,concerned about,was closer to home base in,Warsaw,and that was Saint Stanislaus,Kostka Church,and Father Jerzy Popieluszko.,During legal solidarity the,church wasn't so important--,or the church as an institution,wasn't so important,as a channel of information.,It was only afterwards, after,the banning of solidarity,,that it became important.,So where did it happen?,It got displaced into the,infrastructure of the church,or sympathetic parishes.,Especially those parishes which,were,collecting Western medical aid.,Medical Aid for Poland fund was,set up in response,to Lech Walesa's request to the,west,to provide medical supplies for,Poland,after the imposition of martial,law.,You can imagine it was a lot of,paperwork.,But we filled up lorries.,We had the paperwork in place.,And we sent these lorries across,to Poland.,When Western medical aid,started to flow into churches.,Department 4 was then upgraded,and expanded,and given massive resources,because they were worried.,They were worried that printing,machines, all these kind,of things, money, especially,money,was flowing in through church,channels.,MARTIN SHEEN: Within weeks of,martial law,,leaders of Solidarity that had,escaped capture,joined forces with the,underground, a network,of writers and intellectuals,that,had been printing anti-communist,literature for decades.,ROGER BOYES: But the underground,was really important.,It was important because it kept,the idea alive,,which was an absolute defiance,and really,infuriated the regime.,But also the way it wove into,the rhythm,,the rhythm of Polish society.,And that's where the church came,in.,Because if ever there was a,moment for the underground,to show itself or to flex itself,it,was exactly at Sunday masses.,MARTIN SHEEN: Father Jerzy's,pastor, Father Teofil Bogucki,,asked him to resume the,direction of the next mass,for the fatherland, a monthly,celebration,of Polish national unity.,His first mass was on Sunday,,February 28.,He was a natural, a little,unpolished.,But in his simplicity, he,proclaimed,the truth that cut through the,lies,of the state controlled media.,He spoke of the men arrested and,jailed without cause,,the families left to starve,,even,praying for the men in service,to the Communist Party.,[CONGREGATION SINGING],MARTIN SHEEN: Almost immediately,the secret police appeared,at the door of the Curia, the,headquarters,of the church in Poland.,They complained to Cardinal,Glemp,about the huge crowds, the,seditious sermons,,and the priest.,Cardinal Glemp responded that he,saw,no sedition in Popieluszko's,words, only the work of God.,TRANSLATOR: The prosecutor's,office,had initiated an investigation,against me,for abusing the freedom of,conscience and belief,while fulfilling religious,duties in Warsaw.,Two months into martial law, a,friend of mine came from Warsaw,and he said you must read this.,Read the sermons by the very,young priest,in one of the Warsaw churches,and tell,me what you think about them.,And I read the sermon.,I just could not believe it,,because this,was precisely what was needed.,Every last Sunday of the month,there is a mass for Poland,and bring crosses with you.,Well, I said, well, it's a,strange idea.,I am not going.,Mass passes and people were,saying,,Janusz it's not just common,mass.,Just go there and see the,priest.,His name is Father Jerzy,Popieluszko.,He looked like a normal person,,rather tiny, not very outspoken,,modest and so on.,But when he started to speak,,very simple thing just,gathered in a proper combination,to show,that we have to be ourselves.,That no system invalidates our,duties, that we have duties.,We have limits, we have duties,,and we have to follow,them, as simple as that.,So more and more people gathered,then.,JERZY POPIELUSZKO: [NON-ENGLISH,SPEECH],MARTIN SHEEN: From month to,month,the masses for the fatherland,grew in sophistication,as the crowd grew in number, now,spilling outside,of Saint Stanislaus, which was,illegal without a city permit.,35-year-old Captain Grzegorz,Piotrowski, newly hired,by the secret police, was,stunned,by the size of the crowd and the,brazen words,of this young priest.,Any anti-state pronouncement,was punishable by death.,So he could be killed by,military code,at any time for what he said.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: When the masses for,the homeland,started in February, this place,had,become a piece of free Poland.,The crowds would be surrounded,by ZOMO and the militia.,It was a truly, truly difficult,time.,GRAZYNIA SIKORSKI: ZOMO are the,special units.,They are not police.,They are special security units,,which,are formed from the psychopaths,,from the criminals,,from the worst elements society.,And these people are trained to,kill, to hurt.,They are people without any,morals, any scruples.,I was walking with my wife to,the tram, down the tram,going to Praga and suddenly,secret police came.,They've got us.,And they said, oh, you are a,student, history students.,Oh, how bad.,Who taught you to pray like that,with your fingers.,There is no such letter in,Polish alphabet.,That's what Jaworski was always,telling me.,You will never finish your,studies,and you will stay here for,longer.,I said, you have no right.,And the guy said, what?,What did you say?,Who are you?,TRANSLATOR: Today, there are,steel,hands with fingers that are,spread in the form of a letter.,Not even one Polish word begins,with that letter.,Because of this letter it won't,get better in Poland.,It can only get worse.,-,-,[CONGREGATION SINGING],Maybe 90% of those people,attending the masses they,were Catholics.,But some of them must be like,myself.,So agnostic, atheist, what was,the reason we're coming?,The reason was quite simple.,There we were free, safe, and,not afraid of anything.,And we were fighting for the,independent Poland.,And we knew that Father Jerzy,Popieluszko is one of us.,And we knew that he loves our,country as we love our country.,And that he's not afraid.,[CONGREGATION SINGING],JERZY POPIELUSZKO:,JERZY POPIELUSZKO:,MARTIN SHEEN: Father Jerzy's,small apartment,became the center of the growing,opposition.,It had become a meeting place,for every aspect,of the underground, Solidarity,leaders,,famous actors, intellectuals,,all fired for their support,of Solidarity.,Each group had some influence on,his sermons,and participated in the masses.,But when father Jerzy wanted the,common man's touch,,he went to the steelworkers.,Katarzyna Soborak began working,at Saint Stanislaus in 1982,,helping distribute aid to,families,affected by martial law.,She is now the director of,information services at Kostka,and the curator of Father,Jerzy's archives.,KATARZYNA SOBORAK: [NON-ENGLISH,SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: There was a full,church when I went to the mass,in May.,There were many people inside,and outside the church.,In the next few months the,numbers grew.,There was a park nearby and many,people,were in front of the church, on,the side streets,,and in the park.,So every month, the number of,people attending the mass,for the motherland grew.,MARTIN SHEEN: From the start, he,motivated,the people to stand up with him,against the Communist.,Everyone saw him as an ordinary,man from humble beginnings.,But his example of faith,,conviction, and courage,inspired the people to keep the,flame of Solidarity burning.,JERZY POPIELUSZKO:,JERZY POPIELUSZKO:,MARTIN SHEEN: Every one of his,sermons,was tape recorded and either,transmitted to the West,by phone or hand delivered to,the officers,of Radio Free Europe in Munich.,Now Father Jerzy's voice or,Jerzy,,as he was known in the West, was,being heard throughout Poland,and all of Eastern Europe.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: The government did,not accept,the voice of Radio Free Europe.,And the odor from above was that,it was not to be,considered the truth in Poland.,It was a threat to the Nation.,This communist system was not,equipped for celebrity.,It can't handle celebrity.,That was the problem with,Walesa, in many ways.,He'd become a celebrity and,dangerous.,And Popieluszko now was now,becoming the great celebrity.,And it was done through this,conduit,,this Western radio stations,rebroadcasting his sermons.,And suddenly he wasn't just,reaching 10,000 people.,He was reaching millions.,MARTIN SHEEN: These radio,programs were,deemed illegal by the state.,And simply repeating the content,of any Radio,Free Europe broadcast was,considered an act of espionage.,I'm living here in Warsaw.,First time that the people are,coming,from Silesia, from Gdansk even.,It's very strange.,They've got their own very good,priest and the very brave,priest but they are coming to,Warsaw,to attend the mass at Stanislaus,Kostka Church, very strange.,MARTIN SHEEN: None of this,passed,the notice of the Minister of,Internal Affairs.,General Kiszczak was tired of,reading,reports about Popieluszko's,sermons,and the police budget for the,extra men,needed to cover his masses.,Harassment tactics of slashing,tires and surveillance,had failed.,It was time to increase the,pressure.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: The first attack on,Father Jerzy's life,happened in December of 1982,when they broke his window,and threw in a brick with a,bomb.,Although nothing more than a,firecracker tied to a rock,,the message was clear.,Jacek Lipinski from the steel,mill,immediately surrounded Father,Jerzy and the rectory,with bodyguards.,He asked ex-military fire,captain,Waldemar Chrostowski to drive,and protect Father Jerzy.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: A friend from the,fire academy,turned to me eventually to take,him under my care.,TRANSLATOR: I am aware that they,can intern me,,arrest me, fabricate a scandal.,But I can't stop my activity,,which,is a service to the church and,to the fatherland.,[CONGREGATION SINGING],MARTIN SHEEN: The tension was,building at this one church.,And it was building because the,communist government,could not control it.,They called these masses seances,of hate.,And they were concerned that,Father Jerzy was,building an army, an army of,Catholics,to overthrow the government.,But they could not find a reason,to disband,this great congregation.,[CONGREGATION SINGING],JANUSZ KOTANSKI: I think at that,time,Stanislaus Church was the heart,of Poland.,It was the heart of Poland,because we knew that priest,is ready to die for us.,[CONGREGATION SINGING],[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC],MARTIN SHEEN: Michael Wysocki,has,visited this grave every week,for the past 27 years.,It is the grave of Grzegorz,Przemyk,,the only son of Barbara,Sadowska, a boy,he only knew for 20 minutes.,Barbara worked in the Catholic,Relief Center,and frequently helped Father,Jerzy find medications,banned by martial law.,On May 3rd, 1983, she was,attacked at the relief center.,Her hand was broken.,She was warned to stay away from,Father Popieluszko.,She refused.,A week later, while celebrating,the completion,of his high school exams with,friends,,her son was dragged off the,street into a police car,,driven to a local police,station, and brutally beaten.,MICHAL WYSOCKI: [NON-ENGLISH,SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: At the station one,of the boys,was cursing at the officers.,I was told to take care of the,quiet boy sitting in a chair.,I looked into the young man's,eyes,and they were wide open, glossy,,and frightened.,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],TRANSLATOR: Yes.,I came to the consultation and,Greg,was conscious but in critical,condition, in shock.,He said that he was beaten at,the police,precinct on Jazwyzka Street.,Nevertheless, Doctor Kapinski,definitely operated on him.,As the head surgeon, he opened,his stomach,and he concluded that everything,in his stomach was smashed.,MARTIN SHEEN: Grzegorz Przemyk,died of his injuries,on May 14th, 1983, just two days,after the beating.,His funeral, coordinated by,Father Popieluszko,,turned into a spontaneous,demonstration,against the regime.,Flanked by water cannon, ZOMO,,and the militia,,50,000 people marched two miles,to Powazki Cemetery in silence.,Father Popieluszko said even,pray in silence.,There is a lot of military men,all over because they,were thousands of them.,They will provoke you.,And they will even try to stop,us.,Let him, let Grzegorz Przemyk,can be buried in peace.,JANUSZ KOTANSKI: I knew his,mother.,She was here.,She was sitting just here,running away from militia.,And I saw her and I've noticed,that she's already dead.,That she's completely broken.,So when Grzegorz Przemyk was,killed she was also killed.,MARTIN SHEEN: After the funeral,,Barbara dedicated her life,to the work of Father Jerzy.,She died three years later.,Despite the eyewitness testimony,that Grzegorz was beaten,to death at the police station,,Michal Wysocki, the volunteer,ambulance driver who carried,Grzegorz to the hospital,was falsely convicted of his,murder,and served five years in prison.,But the cover up backfired on,the government,and attendance at the next mass,at St. Stanislaus exploded.,JERZY POPIELUSZKO: [NON-ENGLISH,SPEECH],MARTIN SHEEN: After every Mass,for the Fatherland,,Grzegorz Piotrowski filed,another report about the circus,at Father Jersey's church.,He reported on the presence of,Solidarity,Underground members, activists,,famous actors,,and intellectuals.,And even with all of their,efforts,,this courageous priest stood on,the balcony of his church,and spoke the truth.,And this continued until,December 12, 1983,,when father Jerzy was arrested,for the first time.,They claimed to have found,subversive materials,in his apartment.,At the police station, he was,strip searched,,but the officer apologized,,embarrassed to have,to do this to a priest.,Only after intercession by,Cardinal,Glemp was he released two days,later.,Will you be answering any of,the questions that are asked?,TRANSLATOR: [SPEAKING POLISH],MARTIN SHEEN: Father Jerzy went,to Cardinal Glemp to thank him,,but Glemp had used a lot of,political capital,to get his young parish priest,out of jail.,JOHN MOODY: Popieluszko went,into this meeting thinking,that he was going to be told,,you know, son,,you've done a lot of good.,You have to be careful for your,own safety,and-- but keep up the good work.,And instead he got this--,again, I wasn't there-- but,tongue lashing.,What are you doing?,You're outgrowing your britches.,You know, learn some respect.,Do what I tell you.,Now get out of here.,I'm sure it wasn't phrased quite,that way,,but that's what Popieluszko took,with him in his heart,,and it just crushed him.,TRANSLATOR: It's true that the,primate could have been upset,because writing a letter to,Jaruzelski,in my case cost him a lot.,But the accusations he made,against me,knocked me off my feet.,Secret police during the,interrogation,showed me more respect.,MARTIN SHEEN: Captain Piotrowski,was,assigned two new lieutenants--,Waldemar Chmielewski and Leszek,Pakala.,Colonel Adam Pietruszka warned,them,that the next time they arrested,Father Jerzy,,it had better stick.,Martial law was destroying,Poland's economy,,which owed billions of dollars,to the West.,Jaruzelski would get no more,financial aid until he started,dismantling martial law.,During the summer of 1984, he,called for a general amnesty,,releasing hundreds of Solidarity,leaders and tens of thousands,of common criminals.,The leaders of Solidarity Warsaw,left prison and went,directly to St. Stanislaus.,A week later, Lech Walesa asked,Father,Popieluszko to travel to Gdansk,to celebrate the amnesty.,The crowd buried the priest in,flowers while Lech,Walesa smiled and watched.,It was a clear sign to the,secret police watching,that Father Popieluszko was the,true voice of the growing,call for freedom.,JERZY POPIELUSZKO: [SPEAKING,POLISH],It's difficult for young people,to understand, yeah.,There was no-- no internet, no,satellite,phones, and no Twitter.,There was an event, those masses,for the homeland,,10,000 people heard it.,They spread the word.,But thanks to the technology of,Western radio stations,,it was fed back then into the,country to millions of people.,To millions of people,,Popieluszko,was becoming a national figure.,MARTIN SHEEN: On September 9th,,an article,appeared in the Russian,newspaper,,""Izvestia,"" railing against the,militant Father Popieluszko,,saying his sermons so reek with,hatred for socialism,that they are more like,anti-Bolshevik pamphlets,than proper church sermons.,For the first time, the Russians,had,mentioned Father Jerzy by name.,This was a clear sign from,Moscow,that if Jaruzelski's government,couldn't handle this problem,,then they would find someone who,could.,And that's when everyone,panicked.,Everyone started to panic within,government, not Department 4,,not just the Department for,Buses,,not just the head of the secret,police,,but the whole regime thought, oh,my god, our time's run out.,TRANSLATOR: Difficult to collect,thoughts,,a mental grinding mill.,On April 11th, I was,interrogated for the 11th time.,The secret police said I could,get 38 years in prison.,It was draining him, draining,him.,He put so much into those,masses, he got a lot of advice,about how to do it, and he did,it and he it brilliantly.,But at the end of it all, he was,completely drained.,He was completely wiped out like,a sponge, you know,,that had be squeezed.,And yet people wanted more.,They wanted to touch him.,They wanted to be close to him,and so on, and he couldn't-- he,couldn't handle that.,It was really difficult.,MARTIN SHEEN: In late September,,Colonel Adam Pietruszka called,Piotrowski into his office.,He demanded to know how much,longer he would allow Father,Jerzy to travel all over Poland,freely spreading,his anti-government message.,He said no more games.,Stop planning, stop writing, and,do something.,I surely do not have to tell,you,,comrade, that this decision,comes,from the very highest level.,Pietruszka's efforts to silence,Father Jerzy,began as simple harassment--,slashed tires and vandalism then,arrests,and prolonged interrogations.,In early October, Father Jerzy,boarded a train for Gdansk,followed closely by Piotrowski.,The secret police captain,planned,to catch him near a door and,throw him,off the speeding train, but,Father Jerzy's friends,never let him travel alone.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: The train was a test,in my opinion.,It was an attempt to kill him.,MARTIN SHEEN: The next attempt,on Popieluszko's life,came on the night of October,13th.,Out of nowhere, Piotrowski,stepped out of the darkness,and threw a brick at Father,Jerzy's windshield,,but he missed.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: It wasn't being hit,with the rock.,It was just a test when he threw,the rock, but it didn't work.,We drove on past it to the,church.,MARTIN SHEEN: With every failed,attempt,,the pressure on Piotrowski to,get something done increased.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: There were,situations when,Walde Chrostowski or I was,driving the car,with Father Jerzy and we were,being,followed by the secret police.,I would go to Suchowola with,Father Jerzy,and during one of the trips, his,mother said dramatically,,Jerzy, they can hurt you.,He replied, mother, do not,worry.,I have Jacek and 10,000 people,behind me.,Nobody would dare.,JACEK LIPINSKI: [SPEAKING,POLISH],[APPLAUSE],KATARZYNA SOBORAK: [SPEAKING,POLISH],TRANSLATOR: Later Father Jerzy's,situation got worse.,He received many anonymous,letters with foul language.,They once wrote him a letter,saying that they'd,crucify him and cut his throat.,He read the letters during the,mass.,[SPEAKING POLISH],[APPLAUSE],JERZY POPIELUSZKO: [SPEAKING,POLISH],The man from [POLISH] went to,the primate without,telling Father Popieluszko.,And they begged him to send him,away.,They realized that the pressure,was being turned up,,that the danger level for Father,Popieluszko was way too high.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: At the time, there,was an idea sending your Father,Jerzy to study abroad in Rome.,Friends came up with this idea,to save,him from the danger he was in.,[SPEAKING POLISH],Father Jerzy knew about the,possibility of going to Rome,,and he was really torn in his,decision,because on the one hand, I think,he needed a break by that time.,He was totally exhausted.,But he had this enormous sense,of loyalty, a solidarity,with the people, and just could,not accept the thought,that anybody, not even one,person,,would feel that he betrayed them,and he chose,the easy option that he left,them back in Poland,and went to Rome.,The primate asked Father,Popieluszko.,He met with him, and he said the,men came and talked to me.,They're worried about you.,And father Popieluszko's answer,was I'm not going to leave.,I know what's happening.,I know what's going to happen,,and it's my duty.,I'm doing my job.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: He was aware that,his life was in danger.,He knew about it, but that was,his character.,It was his deep understanding,that he will go down this road.,MARTIN SHEEN: Father Jerzy had,promised,to come celebrate mass with a,seminary colleague,in Bydgoszcz.,He was exhausted, had a bad,cold,,and the staff at St. Stanislaus,wanted him,to cancel and get some sleep.,But Father Jerzy took these,commitments very seriously,and promised he would rest on,the four-hour drive.,JERZY POPIELUSZKO: [SPEAKING,POLISH],Amen.,JAN ZARYN: [SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: On October 19, 1984,,Father,Jerzy and his driver, Waldemar,Chrostowski, left for Bydgosz.,They was supposed to come back,to Warsaw that night.,A car followed them with three,members of the secret police--,Grzegorz Piotrowski, Leszek,Pekala,,and Waldemar Chmielewski.,He was trained as a paratrooper,to roll--,fall properly.,He had the toughness of a fire,fighter.,He had-- he's a strong, strong,man who can do that.,And he has his wits about him.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: There were some,people on the side of the road,,and I ran up to them and told,them that Father,Jerzy had been kidnapped.,The courier immediately put,everybody on alert that Father,Jerzy had been taken.,[SPEAKING POLISH],In eight hours, all the,churches,in Poland knew that Father Jerzy,had,been taken, started a vigil--,a prayer vigil-- and masses in,support of his safe return.,It wasn't that everyone assumed,right from the start,that he was kidnapped.,They had suspicions.,It was more a disappearance.,He had disappeared.,[SINGING IN POLISH],[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: I want to say that,if even one hair falls,from Father Jerzy's head,,someone is,taking a huge responsibility.,We are Christians who think,that.,At the time, I thought this,couldn't end well.,I thought it couldn't end well,because the anger,within the party--,the Communist Party,establishment was too strong.,JERZY POPIELUSZKO: [SPEAKING,POLISH],MARTIN SHEEN: During those,nights as the crowds of people,who were standing vigil outside,the church continued to grow,,it was completely peaceful.,The [POLISH] were forced to back,up further and further,until they disappeared into the,crowd that,was surrounding the church.,[SINGING IN POLISH],JERZY POPIELUSZKO: [SPEAKING,POLISH],TRANSLATOR: Today in the waters,of the lagoon in Wloclawek,,Father Jerzy was found.,[SINGING IN POLISH],[WEEPING],[PRAYING IN POLISH],[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: And my dears will,repeat the hardest truth,,the hardest particularly for you,brothers,of our beloved martyred brother,,Father Jerzy.,We'll repeat three times this,heroic--,this is heroism and forgive us,our sins,as we do those who trespass,against us.,Once more and forgive us our,sins as we,do those who trespass against us,once more.,The reaction of the tens and,hundreds of thousands of people,who followed his words and,followed his sermons,,they didn't do anything.,They did not set fires.,They did not kill Polish police,or attack military bases.,They didn't run into the streets,screaming,into guns and automatic weapons,that,were being trained on them.,They didn't do that.,They did what Popieluszko told,them to do,,which was to keep your dignity,,remain silent,,and don't give up.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: I was able to see,Father Jerzy's body,along with my friend and a,brother,from the priesthoods and a Mr.,Jacek Lipinski,from the Solidarity movement in,Warsaw.,We, along with the mom and dad,decided that he,would be buried in Warsaw.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: At first, I was,going to Bialystok,to identify the body.,I could stomach it because I,worked,in a hospital and an ambulance.,No one from our family would,have known that it was him.,He was so massacred.,His lips were so beaten, they,looked like jelly.,I noticed a birthmark on him,,and that's,how I knew he was my brother.,I was like in shock.,We didn't believe it.,Probably most of the people,didn't believe it,that's going to happen because,everybody,was waiting for Father Jerzy.,Everybody told him he's going to,be maybe not healthy,,but he be alive.,So there was a shock for us.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: On the 11th day at,night during mass,,the horrible news was announced.,When the people cried and,yelled,,I had a different reaction.,I just wanted it to be quiet so,that something,phenomenal could happen, so that,it would be quiet once more.,MARTIN SHEEN: Father Jerzy's,coffin was escorted to the city,limits by hundreds of taxis and,private cars,before making the four-hour,drive to Warsaw where,thousands more were waiting to,welcome,him home for the final time.,On November 3, 1984, over 1,million people,came to his church.,With one voice, They said, ""We,are here, Father Jerzy,,and we heard you."",TRANSLATOR: Rest in peace,,Father Jerzy.,Solidarity is alive because you,gave your life for it.,[SINGING IN POLISH],MARTIN SHEEN: Overriding,longstanding church law,,Father Jerzy was buried just,outside the doors,of his beloved St. Stanislaus,Kostka Church,,just close enough to hear the,pleas of his people,and their continuing prayers for,freedom.,JANUSZ KOTANSKI: And they,decided to frighten Poles,,to murder, to torture the most,popular priest,,and they wanted to say to us you,also must shut up.,Otherwise, you will end up like,Father Popieluszko,at the bottom of Vistula River.,We will kill you.,And the West will not say a,word.,ROGER BOYES: Piotrowski's-- his,anger, his sadism,,and his frustration with the,system and everything that had,gone wrong with Poland and with,his life,,this combination of two things,made for one,of the most brutal murders in,the political,history of Eastern Europe.,It was a message to Poles.,Keep your mouth shut.,You are here, and what's more at,staying here, together,with us, together with Soviet,army,,and with your death of your--,his death.,And you're going to be also,dead, next day.,Shut up.,MARTIN SHEEN: But the people,would not be silenced.,They took to the streets warning,the government that there,would be no more mock trials.,The people would be watching.,From Gdansk to Warsaw, his,message grew louder,in the months after his murder.,His sermons flooded the,underground.,His voice filled the airwaves,louder,and clearer than ever before.,And his Masses for the,Fatherland,continued, a monthly reminder of,what was lost,and what there was left to fight,for.,Their fight continued until the,first free democratic elections,in 1989, when Solidarity won the,majority of seats,in the government five months,before the collapse,of the Berlin Wall.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: He sacrificed his,life for the truth,and for justice.,And this is why the workers,needed him as their role model.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: He was a,representative,of those healthy forces in the,church, voices,that fought against slavery.,His courage, his preaching, cost,him his life.,MARTIN SHEEN: In the end, 28,countries from East Germany,to Russia held open democratic,elections, setting 1 billion,people on the path to freedom.,But it all started in Poland.,It all started in Warsaw in a,rather unremarkable church,with a young priest that gave,his life for his faith,,for his friends, and for his,country.,TRANSLATOR: What will I say to,him?,Dare say?,Even though you're not here, we,have not sold out.,And we can stand proud with our,heads up high 30 years,after martial law.,We came to a realization that,Jerzy is not ours anymore.,He is not our Jerzy from the,steel plant.,The Blessed Father Jerzy,Popieluszko,,his example will lead others to,holiness,and all of the situation and His,Holiness have overwhelmed me.,God wanted us to become close,and to experience it together.,And I thank him for it.,[SPEAKING POLISH],TRANSLATOR: He was everything to,me.,MARTIN SHEEN: Alphonse,Popieluszko,,from the small town of Okopy,,was declared Blessed Father,Jerzy Popieluszko, the last step,to sainthood,before an audience of 350,000,Poles and guests,from all over the world.,His life was a gift, his death a,tragedy, his legacy a miracle.,[SPEAKING POLISH],[THEM MUSIC PLAYING]",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Messenger_of_the_Truth-4208886
